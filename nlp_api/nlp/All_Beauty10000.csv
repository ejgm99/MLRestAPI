5.0,"This was a good story of the Black leagues. I bought the book to teach in my high school reading class. I found it very informative and exciting.

5.0,"Today I gave a book about the Negro Leagues of Baseball to a traveling friend. Its a book I've read more than once and felt that my friend would truly enjoy. It felt like giving a gift that you wanted to keep for yourself. I parted with the book knowing that my friend would enjoy reading it on his journey back east. Before giving him the book I spent about thirty minutes flipping through its pages and saying goodbye to some of the stories in it. I know I'll come across the book again, but for me, parting with books is like wishing a friend well on a journey, just as this friend of mine was journeying. Its great to send a visiting friend off with a friendly gift.

Well, in leafing through the book's pages I came across a few paragraphs I wanted to retain as a memory of my friend the book. Here below are the book and the lines from it that show in words what the negro baseball players faced every day of their lives; a color barrier that prevented them from gaining national sports recognition as professionals of the game they loved so much, baseball. Though Negro men had proven themselves heroic, capable of soldiering bravely in foreign battles of World War II, America was still treating them as second class citizens or less here at home. Major League Baseball would lead the nation in recovering from its racial prejudicial past. The nation today, even with a Black President, is still playing catch up.

4.0,"The story of race relations in American history is one of lost opportunity.  This concise history of the Negro Baseball Leagues for young adult readers illustrates this basic point.  The book discusses the names, dates, and circumstances of the major figures and events of the flip side of American baseball history. Legendary names such as Josh Gibson, ""Cool Papa"" Bell, and Satchel Page are just a few of the remarkable players who made important contributions to the game.  Among others, they played for teams with names such as The Homestead Grays, The St. Louis Stars, and The Kansas City Monarchs.  The book also tells the story of owners and managers, such names as Negro National League founder Rube Foster and the tough as nails woman owner of the Newark Eagles, Effa Manley spring to mind.  The book also briefly explains how the infamous Jim Crow tradition brought about the Negro Baseball saga.  In 1947, major league baseball was sucessfully integrated and that spelled the doom of the Negro Baseball leagues.  The text includes an ample number of photographs.  To assist younger readers, and for easy reference purposes, a player profile and time line section is provided at the back of the book.  Underlying the historical text, there is the theme that segregated baseball mirrored the nagging problem of racism in America.  A sense of fair play and even-handed justice demands that talent, skill, and just plain style should be celebrated, regardless of race.  To do otherwise cheats everybody of a rewarding experience.  Imagine if the great players of the Negro Baseball Leagues had the chance to play (with or against) the great players of the major leagues.  Consider the void created by lost opportunity.  ;-)","Baseball, America, and racism.","['story', 'race', 'relation', 'american', 'history', 'one', 'lose', 'opportunity', 'concise', 'history', 'negro', 'baseball', 'league', 'young', 'adult', 'reader', 'illustrate', 'basic', 'point', 'book', 'discusse', 'name', 'date', 'circumstance', 'major', 'figure', 'event', 'flip', 'side', 'american', 'baseball', 'history', 'legendary', 'name', 'josh', 'gibson', 'cool', 'papa', 'bell', 'satchel', 'page', 'remarkable', 'player', 'make', 'important', 'contribution', 'game', 'among', 'other', 'play', 'team', 'name', 'homestead', 'grays', 'st', 'louis', 'star', 'kansas', 'city', 'monarchs', 'book', 'also', 'tell', 'story', 'owner', 'manager', 'name', 'negro', 'national', 'league', 'founder', 'rube', 'foster', 'tough', 'nail', 'woman', 'owner', 'newark', 'eagle', 'effa', 'manley', 'spring', 'mind', 'book', 'also', 'briefly', 'explain', 'infamous', 'jim', 'crow', 'tradition', 'bring', 'negro', 'baseball', 'saga', 'major', 'league', 'baseball', 'sucessfully', 'integrate', 'spell', 'doom', 'negro', 'baseball', 'league', 'text', 'include', 'ample', 'number', 'photograph', 'assist', 'young', 'reader', 'easy', 'reference', 'purpose', 'player', 'profile', 'time', 'line', 'section', 'provide', 'back', 'book', 'underlie', 'historical', 'text', 'theme', 'segregated', 'baseball', 'mirror', 'nag', 'problem', 'racism', 'america', 'sense', 'fair', 'play', 'evenhanded', 'justice', 'demand', 'talent', 'skill', 'plain', 'style', 'celebrate', 'regardless', 'race', 'otherwise', 'cheat', 'everybody', 'rewarding', 'experience', 'imagine', 'great', 'player', 'negro', 'baseball', 'league', 'chance', 'play', 'great', 'player', 'major', 'league', 'consider', 'void', 'create', 'lose', 'opportunity']"

I also would've liked to see more than one or two pages of Aisling illustrations.

I prefer, however, a brush to be held far above the comb near the end of the brush handle.  (Most pictures of brush stands show them holding the brush at the comb, but I think that looks weird and top-heavy.  Call me weird, then.)  The arms are too narrow for the Omega.  I have a tool for opening / closing links of chain and I used it, but the result was a very wide V shape and I didn't want to put the somewhat fragile plastic handle in position while I used the tool to squeeze the V shape into more of a C shape.  So I put it back into its original shape.  Ill save as its a very good stand, and if I get a brush that will work the way I want to suspend the brush, I certainly will use this.

In  the meantime, what then to do with one's razor and, more importantly, one's shaving brush which must be stored with the bristles facing downward so the knot does not get ruined from getting soaked?  Also, this unit is rather tall, so it will not easily fit into a cabinet recess or on a cabinet shelf.

5.0,"This stand is just perfect. It looks great, and the construction is solid, but not it's uncomfortably heavy to lift. It's balanced, so that if you have a heavy safety razor on the one side (like my Merkur 34C, for example), and no brush on the other, the stand is perfectly stable. (Then again, shaving brushes aren't exactly heavy, are they? They are not. The point is, you don't have to worry about it tipping it over if you don't have a brush yet. And if you don't have a brush yet, you should consider getting one of those next!) But I do in fact store one of my badger-hair brushes on the other side (the German-made one, of course!), and it stays in place pretty well. Much more satisfying than those little plastic stands a lot of brushes come with. The patterned steel in the middle of the stand is also an attractive element, adding visual interest and complementing the similar texture of the razor handle.

4.0,"I bought this as a gift to add to the quality shaving brush and other shaving products for my son in law.  I selected it among several on the market and examined it carefully after receiving it. It is exactly what I had hoped for, namely, solid chromed metal, enough weight not to be tippy, able to be screwed apart, hopefully rustproof...we'll see...and able to hold the brush and razor purchased separately.  I might have given it 4 stars if I had been able to use it myself.  If my son-in-law likes it, I'll get this one also for myself as I now have a quality brush given to me in a package of creams, etc., but without a stand.  After only a month of enjoying lathering with a brush, I see that it is definitely necessary to have a stand to hang it upside down to allow water not to sit in and on the handle to eventually corrode the handle and the brush hairs at their base.

The base is pretty heavy, which keeps it upright when the brush and razor are resting on it.  The Perfect Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand hold the Escali and Merkur perfectly.

5.0,"I bought this stand shortly after changing from canned shaving cream to a beaver brush system to help preserve the brush.  It is a very solid, well constructed hanger for both the brush and some razors.  The razor hanging side does not work for my particular razor (Mach 3 which is a rather dated design by a major manufacturer) but the brush holder is a must to help keep you beaver brush rinsed clean and allowed to dry.  The product comes with instructions for disassembly and thorough cleaning of the stand which I really appreciate.  The fact that it does not hold my particular razor does not cause me any real concern because, due to the number of different razor designs on the market these days, I doubt that it is possible to design a system that could work for every conceivable razor on the market.  Who knows, I may change razors next?
My primary use for this stand from the start was to keep the beaver brush clean and to allow it to dry thoroughly between uses and it performs admirably for that purpose.  In addition it is well made and based on the quality of construction I anticipate that the finish and the stand will hold up for several years of everyday use.

laying around on the counter itself.

Holds double-edge safety razors with no problem, and will hold single-edge if you point the blade inward (at least with the GEM's I have).  the ONLY criticism i have of this product is that the brush holder could be a little wider.  some brushes just won't fit.  The Semogue Owners club is a prime example - the knot will fit, but when wet, the knot is being pressed rather hard against the sides of the holder, which in my mind could damage the bristles.

5.0,"Stand looks great on my bathroom counter- fits my Parker faux horn handle silvertip brush well (at the top with the chrome plated holder, not from the handle itself- I find this better anyhow, as I find that stands that grip the brush from the handle seem to mangle the bristles). I purchased a Princeton Shaving Club chrome DE safety razor, and it is 5.25 inches long- which unfortunately does not fit well in this stand. I am able to get it to work by angling the handle away from the head so the handle is not on top of the base of the stand which allows it to hang. This is not a fault in the stand, I just saw the descriptions and saw that it was over 6 inches high and hoped it would fit this razor- but I am not to worried about it.

It also stated that this was caused by ""shipping"" issues.

I have now tightened the stem to the base by pressing up on the center of the foam while rotating the stem. That tightened everything together.

The other aspects of the stand are lovely and I like it a lot, but I don't believe that QC is doing their job if the stem is able to work loose during shipment. In fact I don't believe the stem was properly tightened in the factory.

5.0,"Like many of us folks out there who need to shave it lease once a day, I became extremely tired of dealing with these financially outrageous and environmentally damaging disposable razors, no matter how many dozens of blades they now staked on them.  If anything, the more blades they put on the surface, the more chance of soap and hair getting into the gaps, therefore making of the blades dull  almost immediately.  And perhaps thats the purpose in the first place so that we throw them away quicker!  Therefore like so many others now, I had a great desire to go retro, and like my father, use a classic single blade and razor, as well as stop using equally environmentally disastrous and hard on your skin aerosol shaving soaps, and instead, again like my father, use a brush and soap cup.  While I was purchasing these items I also noticed this neat looking stand which actually makes sense in that you can put your brush on it to keep it dry as well as your razor so you don't have to search for it every morning on your bathroom sink.  There are many choices for this kind of stand.  And it may seem silly to spend so much time researching the best one, but this is something of it literally could last a lifetime.

5.0,"Just what I needed to hold my safety razor and brush between uses.  The finish on it is perfect and matches the polish and finish on my Edwin Jagger DE89 perfectly.

My only complaint is the stand arrived with the pole loose in the base and the soft foam applied to the bottom of the base covers the nut that you could use to tighten the pole back up.  I debated cutting a small hole in the foam to reach the nut, but found I could press hard on the area of the foam and keep enough pressure on the nut to screw the pole down.  So, I would suggest to the manufacturer to make sure the unit is tightly assembled before applying the foam to the base, or cut a small hole in the foam to allow access to the nut.

The whole stem rocks back and forth to the point that it is unusable.  Unfortunately, short of removing the glued on mat at the bottom (and damaging the item), there's no way to screw it in.  Since the reviews are generally excellent and thinking this may be a one-time defect, I ordered a second one (there was no exchange option available on Amazon) and the issue on the second item was identical.  So I will be returning both.

4.0,"Let me lead off by saying I had to return this product, but it wasn't because of defect, but the size of my shaving brush.

For the price this stand is very nice. Feels solid. Chrome finish is bright and consistent. The brush opening was just too small for my shave brush. And it lacked a curve to keep the brush from falling out.

It's hefty and feels very solid.

I don't care too much what my stuff looks like, but the stand is very pretty as well. Super shiny and very ""premium"" looking. And I appreciate it's small size too. Many of the stands sold at my local shaving shop are pretty large and bulky (often including extra sections for other items or just having large bases), the bathroom in my house is large but spend a lot of time at friend's place watching the house while they travel for work and their apartment is tiny and has no space for large stands.

If you're getting into wet shaving and start out with Amazon's popular and economical Escali brush this stand will serve its purpose.

If the manufacturer had increased the inner diameter of the brush holder by 1/8"" this issue would have been solved.  It is possible in most cases to slide the brush into the stand where the bristles meet the handle but this leaves the brush unbalanced and easy to knock off the stand. This method also needs to be done with care as it increases the possibility of damaging the hairs or fibers on the brush.  Looks like I'm in the market for a replacement stand.

This stand has a very even, smooth, attractive finish on it. I was surprised how even and straight the stipling on the neck is. I am hanging a high end razor in it and the stipling looks right at home next to the razor.
The neck screws into the nicely weighted and padded base, and locks up tight and straight. It really couldn't be any straighter or more solid feeling.

4.0,"I love this planner! The cover is stunningly gorgeous but I also love that it allows you to slip your own photos or artwork inside, if you choose. This planner is perfect for someone like me who needs to be able to toss it their purse while on the go. I'm a mom to 3 teens and also a book blogger so I live by my schedule! This planner is small and durable so it won't get beat up along with everything in my purse which is great but it's also large enough to have plenty of room to plan out my days. Each month starts with a monthly overview in which each dated square has lines to write within, I'm a messy writer if I don't have lines so this was a big draw for me when it came to choosing a planner. After the overview page, each week is laid out over 2 pages with the most space being devoted to Mon-Fri and again, each dated box is lined allowing me to really plan out my day effectively. At the back of the planner there is several pages for notes and a laminated listing of holidays and even a US map showing states, capitals & time zones which I thought was pretty cool. In the front of the planner you have a yearly overview of 2016 and 2017 which is always a plus to have and there's a few pages for profile info, emergency contacts, and general contacts. I'd say the only downside that I found was that the monthly pages go only through Dec 2016. I'm used to planners that give you a month or two of the following year at the end which was always great since my blog needs to be scheduled several months in advance.

Only problem I had with it and the 4 stars is that the foam piece on the bottom came loose right out of the box.  I'm not sure if that's because it was so cold lately and the package was traveling in a cold truck and caused the adhesive to release or if its a quality control issue; or maybe it's even supposed to come out.

Come the time I was christmas shopping I decided to look at the reviews for various stands, until I saw this one. I purchased this stand based on the many positive reviews on the product and they could not be more right.

First off, the weight of the stand is impressive. I need to try and tip it over.

Second, the stand is athletically pleasing and matches my razor. No matter the color scheme of your bathroom it will match.

Third, this stand will hold every razor and brush that I own. (Not that I own that many)

Granted this stand does have one fault that the positive greatly outweighs. The brush side of the stand will not grasp the handle of the brush. Something that I find works is that you could rest the handle on top, near the knot of bristles.

Overall this is a fantastic stand and I can not put it into a review.

This Will Prolong The Life Of Your Shaving Brush</a>

This is a completely unbiased review.  I have in no way received this item at a discount or for free from the seller/manufacturer.  I had been looking at this product based on user's reviews and had it sitting in my Amazon cart when the missus went and bought me a Razor and Brush Stand from that big Mall Shaving store we shall not speak of.  Of course the price was also exponentially higher than what the Pop! Shop sells this item on Amazon for.  To cut to the chase, Amazon Prime delivered this order PDQ and the stand received the much sought after WAF (Wife Acceptance Factor).  The mall store purchase was returned unused ASAP.  The stand has a nice finish, is well balanced and looks good all around.

The size is small and light enough to fit into my messenger bag when I make my commutes in a densely populated city (Seoul). When the organizer is too big or heavy (some organizers use paper that is too heavy), I dislike carrying it around and do not end up using it much.

Be very careful it spreads apart very easy even when you do not think it is.  Look for something that's barely snug. Now the prongs themselves.

5.0,Absolutely as advertised - beautiful !!!! I have been using a mug / brush for well over 50 (WOW !!) years and have always stored the brush bristles up.

Live and learn. Bristles are now very well dried and separate. The stand base is weighted and the plating should easily outlast me. My only concern (still 5 stars) is that some razors tend to slip out of the retainer. The simple addition of a very small / hard to see rubber band at the tip of the fork solved the problem.

Holds your brush
Holds your razor
Won't tip over
Won't catch fire
Doesn't give you funny looks when you ask it to hold your razor and/or brush unlike someone I know
Looks sleek
Hefty

Cons:
Doesn't do things unrelated to holding your brush or razor

I'm not sure if there is a ""better"" stand than this, so I'm just going to say it's literally the best stand you can buy for holding your razor and/or brush.

5.0,"This travel set includes all three of the bottles. They have a suction cup on the side so you can attach them to a mirror, shower stall ect... Pretty useful.

They are accurate to the picture online to color so do not think they are red white and blue like the description. They are more pink, opaque, and blue. They are made of a thicker but soft and squishy silicone. They appear to be high quality.

What stands then apart from the cheapo travel bottles you get at drugstore in that thick silicone material, the snap shut bottom, suction cup on side and the squeeze every little bit of product out construction.

5.0,"I am very pleased with this stand.  It is well made and holds my brush perfectly.  The razor, a two blade Gillette Sensor, will not stay in the stand, but that is not the stand's fault.  The razor has a tapered head and it flips in the slot and falls through.  Quick fix, I put two wire ties on the handle of the razor so that the retaining nubs are 180 degrees apart.  The razor sits nicely on the nubs.  It looks like hell, but works great.  Long term fix is to buy a couple of o-rings the correct size and stretch over the razor supports on the stand.  The o-rings will hold the razor against the back of the slot.  Again these problems are caused by the shape of the razor not the stand.

I have had this stand for only a week, but so far I am quite impressed with it.  The stand has a simple mechanical beauty that is reflective of the Bauhaus movement.  Simple, functional, yet beautiful. The chrome plating is thick and appears to be well applied.  I believe it will resist rusting with the minimal of care.  The knurling on the shaft and top nut are precise and functional.  All in all it is hard to believe that this stand was as inexpensive as it is.

My only concern is that the soft material lining the base may not resist water for long.  The base appears to be solid under this material and I believe it will be an easy matter to replace the lining with an alternate material if it does get water damaged.

An alternate fix for my razor problem would be to buy Merkur Futur razor.  That would really make my stand look good, but I am afraid I would hurt myself with the Mekur!  The o-ring seems a far cheaper and safer solution.  Lest you think me a purist, the brush is faux-silver tipped badger made with synthetic fibers.  My wife, an animal lover, would file for divorce if I bought a real badger brush.

EDIT 9-10-15 While looking for something to get my o-ring order over $35 for free shipping (yes I know get Prime), I found a Merkur 38C razor.  I think it does a lot to improve the looks of my stand.  It turns out I don't need the o-rings.

5.0,"I had grown tired of the leaks from the carrying those small sample bottles, re-purposed as my travel bottle set. I had been looking for reusable bottles to carry all my personal products without having to worry about the leak or the mess while flying.

Then I came across these and I jumped at it. Just what I was looking for! I can now carry my personal care products without worrying about the leaks or playing a guessing game about the volume. Easy to refill and very convenient to carry my sunscreen, face wash etc. Appears to be made from very good quality silicone and comes in a nice transparent bag. The suction cup is handy, so now you can just stick it on the tile not having to fiddle with bottles while you're under the shower. Neat implementation.

I do have issue with the ID window on the cap. It's too small and the labels are barely legible. I go with the color associations than rely on reading the labels. e.g. Reddish one for Sunscreen, white for lotion and Blue for shampoo etc.

All in all, a great addition to my travel kit and highly recommend it. I'm going to stock up on these.

5.0,"I have wanted these for the longest time! Made of high quality silicone, these 3 oz. travel containers are everything I thought they would be and more.

First of all, they have lids that can easily be removed, yet they don't leak! I trialed it out by filling them with water, closing the cap and squeezing the bottle. Because my biggest concern is what kind of mess they would make if they leaked, I was REALLY HAPPY that not even a drop escaped through the lid or around the neck of the bottle. VERY NICE.

The silicone is soft and supple and they came in a clear Ziploc style bag that definitely could be used to put them in, but I actually trust them not to leak so I think I could put them in my regular bathroom bag.

Finally, they have 1 strong suction cup on each 3 oz. bottle so they stick to the gym shower wall (or wherever it is you end up). It has already proven to be very convenient. I actually have one in my shower right now that is suctioned upside-down with some salon conditioner my hair stylist wanted me to try before I purchased. I just pop the lid open and squeeze it right into my hand...no dripping or mess or waste. Love them!

PROS:
1. I WAS ABLE TO PICK MY COLORS AND DID NOT HAVE TO RELY ON THE WHIM OF A COMPUTER OR STOCK PERSON PICKING FOR ME
2 . I ASKED FOR TWO RED TOWELS, ONE GREEN TOWEL; ONE YELLOW TOWEL; ONE ORANGE TOWEL AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I RECEIVED
3. WHEN I MADE THE ORDER, I WENT TO THE BUTTON THAT SAID ""CONTACT SELLER""' WHICH LED ME TO AN EMAIL PAGE WHERE I PICKED THE COLORS AND NOTIFIED THE VENDOR
4. THE VENDOR REPLIED WITHIN AN HOUR AND LET ME KNOW THAT THOSE PARTICULAR COLORS WERE IN STOCK AND THAT HE WOULD SEND THEM OUT THE NEXT DAY
5. HE SENT ME THE NAME OF THE DELIVERER AND THE NUMBER OF THE TRANSACTION SO THAT I COULD FOLLOW THE PROGRESS AS SOON AS THEY WERE SHIPPED, WHICH WAS THE NEXT DAY
6. I ORDERED THESE ON A FRIDAY AND RECEIVED THEM AT 10:30 AM THE FOLLOWING MONDAY
7. THE COLORS ARE TRUE
8. THE FRINGE IS HEAVIER DUTY THAN THE TOWELS THEMSELVES WHICH MAKES THEM LOOK MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THEY WERE
9. VERY REASONABLY PRICED
10. A FAIRLY THIN TOWEL, BUT THAT WAS MY PREFERENCE AS THEY ARE FOR THE GUEST BATH WHERE PAPER FINGER TIP TOWELS ARE KEPT FOR THE DAY VISITORS AND THESE WILL GENERALLY ONLY BE USED FOR THE GUESTS I HAVE OVERNIGHT WHICH MAY ONLY BE 2-3 TIMES A YEAR

CONS:

1. I SUSPECT THAT THE FRINGE ON ANY OF THESE TOWELS WHETHER HIGH HIGH QUALITY OR OF THE LESS EXPENSIVE VARIETY WHICH I PICKED, WILL BE A CHALLENGE IN THE WASHER.
2. I PLAN TO HAVE MINE DRY CLEANED AND LET THEM WORRY ABOUT THE FRINGE...OR THE FRINGE MAY REQUIRE IRONING AS MIGHT THE TOWEL
3. I HAVE NOT WASHED THEM, DO NOT PLAN TO DO SO, SO I CANNOT ADDRESS THEIR COLOR FASTNESS; HOWEVER, SHOULD I WASH THEM, I WOULD USE THE PRODUCT ""SHOUT"" TO INSURE NO COLOR RUNNING

5.0,"This Perfecto Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand has simplified my life and bathroom counter. Whereas before I was placing all my shaving items into a corner and even knocking them over in the process, the mess is now reduced. This stand is an exact fit for my Perfecto shave brush, and it will hold other brushes too. See the product description for dimensions. The stand has a weighted base, so it never gets top-heavy. The chrome finish is sleek and clean...exactly what shaving represents. It definitely shows off the razor and brush, while preserving them equally. I'm especially pleased that the mid-section and top fastener of this stand have been cross-hatched for gripping purposes. You can move it easily and not have to add unsightly fingerprints in the process.

Even though the product description touts this stand being able to increase the lifespan of your shave brush, I'm not buying that idea completely. My last shave brush lasted many years and I never had this stand, or any stand for that matter. How long can a brush possibly last? I do think this stand will be much better for the drying process of my brush. I think this stand is slightly over-priced, but I'm glad I bought it. I paid $16.95 [08-25-15] and that was a sale price. The regular price (note: NOT the list price) was $29.95. Personally, I never would have paid that much for a stand.

5.0,I was frankly surprised at the quality for the price.  They have black silicon handles and brushes which I love.  They are two in the package so I and use the smaller one on things like vegetables and the bigger one to brush butter on corn or bread when I bake.  The middle is heavy duty clear plastic and they are heavier than any I've tried before. They fit my hand perfectly and are small enough that my 7 year old grandson can use them to help me baste the chicken or pastries we make.

5.0,"This set of basting and pastry brushes are absolutely awesome.  I have tried other varieties of brushes, only to have them lose bristles or simply glob up with the dressing.  I even had a pastry brush that melted when I used it in the oven - yechh!  The brushes of this product are silicone, which means they do not melt and they wash up superbly and simply.  The round brush is my favorite for basting butter over my pastries - makes short work of making garlic rolls.  I use the other, flatter brush for my meat - even though both wash up perfectly in the dishwasher, I still prefer to separate my meat tools from my pastry tools.  I especially like the wider handles - they give me more control over the brush and slip less in my hand - that prevent me from getting burnt by grabbing for a slippery brush in the oven.  Definitely recommend this quality product!

The caps are sturdy and don't seem as if they will break easily; they do not leak and appear to be of good quality silicone. Very easy to refill as they have a nice wide quarter-size opening, and they have suction cups on the back! Strong enough to hold a full tube up in the shower while you pop the lid, squeeze out what you need and close it...super convenient! They come in a zip top clear plastic bag perfect for traveling.

If you shave with a brush, soap, and double edge razor (I would recommend the Merkur Heavy Duty Double Edge Razor #34C), you need look no further for perfection.  For fans of nostalgia, I will enter this:  it makes shaving fun again.  Qualifier:  If you are the type of person that would never consider a Manual Transmission vehicle to drive because you are not interested in new challenges, this type of shaving is not for you.  Driving a Manual Transmission makes driving fun again.  I have never owned an automatic.  IF you are truly looking for a perfect ""Hot Shave"", it is.

First, let me start by saying that I absolutely love this razor stand and I don't believe that I will ever have to buy another.
As far as looks go, this stand is simply gorgeous with a very simple, timeless design complete with a very bright, shiny chrome with a rough patch like the handle of my safety razor. It defeinelty has the look and feel you would expect from a razor stand. As far as the build, the stand is extremely solid and has some definite weight to it; you would be hard-pressed to try and tip this bad boy over. The stand is also pretty tall and hold my brush (Escali 100% Badger) and my razor (Merkur Long Handle 34C aka Model 180) with plenty of room to spare underneath so it will absolutely hold whatever you throw at it.

5.0,As a younger guy I would have laughed at this product.  Now that I'm getting up in years lets just say things don't flow the way they used to.  I don't like taking laxatives or drinking prune juice or any of that because then things just start to get messy.  Someone told me about this stool thing and I was skeptical at first.  Saw Dr. Flo-Pro on amazon and for the price it was a small risk to take.  Dude.. it works!  Holy crap it works! It's like something triggers in your gut and everything falls into place.  Hard to really explain it but I'm happy I took the risk.  Also... if you're wondering where to put it after you use it...no worries.  It slides right under the toilet seat perfectly.  I live in a tiny NYC apartment and it tucks away just fine and out of the way.  I love my flow with the pro!  And yes I just wrote a review on a doo doo accessory.

5.0,"My shaving brush bit the dust. So I needed to buy a new one. But I am philosophically opposed to paying for shipping if I don't have to. Well, the new brush wasn't nearly expensive enough to earn me free shipping, so I added the Perfect Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand to my order. It was kind of an impulse buy, but I had been wanting something like this for a long time. I bought *something* from a local seller of linens and things several years ago, and it worked... kinda, but it was really more of a toothbrush/toothpaste holder than a bush and razor stand. So I was pleased to be able to finally buy a razor and brush stand that was definitely designed and intended as a razor and brush stand.

I will tell you, I was a little anxious. A reviewer of the brush I bought said she bought this stand with it, and it was a perfect fit, so I was reasonably confident that wouldn't be an issue--and it was not, the Semogue brush does, in fact, fit perfectly. But I had no idea whether my razor would fit in the razor side of the Perfecto stand, or if it did fit, if the stand would hold it securely. So when my package arrived today, I rushed up to my vanity to try it out. It isn't obvious to me from the photo, but the razor fork on this stand is deep enough to slide under the safety razor head, and the fingers at the end of the fork are bent upwards just a bit, to help keep the razor on the stand.

What's also not obvious is that there is a rubber pad on the bottom of this stand so that you don't scratch up your vanity, or leave corrosion marks, or anything like that. The stand is quite sturdy, grips the surface of the vanity well, holds my brush and razor perfectly, and has a certain old-world design that looks just perfect with my brush and safety razor. I think I might need to order a small chrome bowl to keep my shaving soap in now, since my Beethoven mug just doesn't look right sitting next to this stand, but that's another purchase for another day.

One last thing, and I don't know whether this really belongs in a review of the product, but when the product was shipped, the projected arrival date was Saturday, 3/21, but it actually arrived on 3/19. I love getting free shipping, and I'm resigned to having to wait... and wait... and wait for my merchandise for the sake of not paying for the shipping, so when a product arrives early, that's cause to celebrate.",Fits my razor and brush like it was made to their dimensions!,"['shaving', 'brush', 'bit', 'dust', 'need', 'buy', 'new', 'one', 'philosophically', 'oppose', 'pay', 'shipping', 'nt', 'well', 'new', 'brush', 'nt', 'nearly', 'expensive', 'enough', 'earn', 'free', 'shipping', 'add', 'perfect', 'deluxe', 'chrome', 'razor', 'brush', 'stand', 'order', 'kind', 'impulse', 'buy', 'want', 'something', 'like', 'long', 'time', 'buy', 'something', 'local', 'seller', 'linen', 'thing', 'several', 'year', 'ago', 'work', 'kinda', 'really', 'toothbrushtoothpaste', 'holder', 'bush', 'razor', 'stand', 'pleased', 'able', 'finally', 'buy', 'razor', 'brush', 'stand', 'definitely', 'design', 'intend', 'razor', 'brush', 'stand', 'tell', 'little', 'anxious', 'reviewer', 'brush', 'buy', 'say', 'buy', 'stand', 'perfect', 'fit', 'reasonably', 'confident', 'would', 'nt', 'issue', 'semogue', 'brush', 'fact', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'idea', 'whether', 'razor', 'would', 'fit', 'razor', 'side', 'perfecto', 'stand', 'fit', 'stand', 'would', 'hold', 'securely', 'package', 'arrive', 'today', 'rush', 'vanity', 'try', 'nt', 'obvious', 'photo', 'razor', 'fork', 'stand', 'deep', 'enough', 'slide', 'safety', 'razor', 'head', 'finger', 'end', 'fork', 'bent', 'upwards', 'bit', 'help', 'keep', 'razor', 'stand', 'also', 'obvious', 'rubber', 'pad', 'bottom', 'stand', 'nt', 'scratch', 'vanity', 'leave', 'corrosion', 'marks', 'anything', 'like', 'stand', 'quite', 'sturdy', 'grip', 'surface', 'vanity', 'well', 'hold', 'brush', 'razor', 'perfectly', 'certain', 'oldworld', 'design', 'look', 'perfect', 'brush', 'safety', 'razor', 'think', 'may', 'need', 'order', 'small', 'chrome', 'bowl', 'keep', 'shaving', 'soap', 'since', 'beethoven', 'mug', 'nt', 'look', 'right', 'sit', 'next', 'stand', 'another', 'purchase', 'another', 'day', 'one', 'last', 'thing', 'nt', 'know', 'whether', 'really', 'belong', 'review', 'product', 'product', 'ship', 'project', 'arrival', 'date', 'saturday', 'actually', 'arrive', 'love', 'get', 'free', 'shipping', 'resign', 'wait', 'wait', 'wait', 'merchandise', 'sake', 'pay', 'shipping', 'product', 'arrive', 'early', 'cause', 'celebrate']"

5.0,"This razor and brush holder is absolutely brilliant.  My Merkur Long-Handled Razor fits perfectly into it along with my badger hair bristled brush.  The base is heavy so the piece does not topple during use.  You can tell that it is made of high quality materials, and that it will retain its rich luster for many, many years.  The piece also comes apart for easy cleaning, but I find it easier to lightly dry my razor and brush prior to placing it in the holder.  Occasionally, you can see a few water spots on the bright finish, but these quickly buff off by hand with a microfiber cloth (I keep one handy in the bathroom as all of my fixtures are polished stainless).  I was so impressed with this piece that I ordered another for a friend of mine's birthday.  His wife bought him the Merkur Razor, and I purchased the Perfecto stand.  Don't overthink this purchase.

We could  tell the difference the wine that we had poured into the glass using the aerator..  It had a stronger smell (which was a good thing) and the taste of the wine was amazing.

4.0,The stand is great with a solid base. The razor side holds your razor safely and out of the way. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the narrow neck on the brush side. It won't fit Parker brushes well and you either have to place it at the base of the bristles or tilt the brush so it sticks out at a 45 degree angle. If you have a lot of space on the counter it's not a big deal.  There's no way to widen the opening to make it fit your particular brush.

She is about 30-35 lbs, and looks like miniature black lab (she's a shelter dog).  One day I chained her up, and when I went to let her in, she was nowhere to be found.  All I saw was a broken collar on the end of the leash...  There were no signs of chewing, and it almost looked as though it was cut.  It was a completely clean break right were it is sewn together.

shaving with vintage Gillette razors since before they were considered old school (1967) but decided to add
a shiny new razor to this stand so I also purchased a Amazon exclusive to hang from it. The razor is an Edwin

Prior to purchasing the Perfecto Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand, my razor and brush were simply leaned on their sides on my shelf.  Leaving a badger shaving brush like this can cause the hairs to attract mildew, etc so it is critical to hang your shave brush for proper drying.

This shaving stand solved my problem of having nowhere to hang my brush and razor between uses.  The stand itself is a beautiful chrome with a knurled post.  I must say, the chrome and the knurl complement my Merker 34C quite nicely and are similar finish and quality.

The brush would not dry out properly sanding on it's base and the razer would just sit on the cabinet top and not dry properly either.  So, I sought and found this solution.  I couldn't be happier.  The stand looks nice and holds the razer and brush so that they dry vertically.

I only have one complaint.  Like most people nowadays I use a disposable head, multi-blade razer and it was initially hard to keep the razer balanced in the hooks.

5.0,"Fantastic quality. I was a bit hesitant at first to purchase a stand, but I had just got into shaving with a traditional safety razor (great decision by the way) and I felt the stand was necessary; particularly for ensuring the Badger brush retained its texture and shape. This stand not only serves its purpose in terms of functionality, but also aesthetically. A traditional shave is a great, soothing experience and this stand contributes to making your shave as enjoyable as possible. The chrome plating matches my Murker razor almost exactly, and the weighted base gives the stand a sturdy, quality feel. No complaints whatsoever, I can't think of anything they could improve here.

I decided it was time to see what the classic shave was all about... After a little research, I purchased Proraso Shaving Soap, a Merkur (long handled) safety razor, an Escali Badger brush, and a Perfecto chrome razor and brush stand. I didn't know what I had been missing, and I do not know why we have settled for the mediocre Gillette shave for so long. This is the ONLY way to shave.

With regard to the Proraso shaving soap specifically, my experiences have been top notch. The sent reminds me of the barber shop; I would describe it almost as a combination of talcum powder and a mild soap.  It froths up very well, and it has a numbing effect when lathered on the face. I shave with the cold water on (under which I repeatedly rinse my razor), and that numbing effect combined with the cold steel of the safety razor produces a very soothing and enjoyable shave. NOTE, however, it is recommended that you do NOT rinse your blade with cold water. You are supposed to rinse with warm water, as a cold blade can increase the chance of cutting yourself (I have yet to cut myself doing this, though).

The Merkur (long handle) safety razor and Escali Badger brush both fit perfectly in their respective slots. I would highly recommend both of those products as well.

I strongly believe that if the seller continues to provide this quality stand at its comparatively low price point, it will fair very well with this product.",Fantastic Product,"['fantastic', 'quality', 'bit', 'hesitant', 'first', 'purchase', 'stand', 'get', 'shaving', 'traditional', 'safety', 'razor', 'great', 'decision', 'way', 'feel', 'stand', 'necessary', 'particularly', 'ensure', 'badger', 'brush', 'retain', 'texture', 'shape', 'stand', 'serve', 'purpose', 'term', 'functionality', 'also', 'aesthetically', 'traditional', 'shave', 'great', 'soothe', 'experience', 'stand', 'contribute', 'make', 'shave', 'enjoyable', 'possible', 'chrome', 'plating', 'match', 'murker', 'razor', 'almost', 'exactly', 'weighted', 'base', 'give', 'stand', 'sturdy', 'quality', 'feel', 'complaint', 'whatsoever', 'ca', 'nt', 'think', 'anything', 'could', 'improve', 'decide', 'time', 'see', 'classic', 'shave', 'little', 'research', 'purchase', 'proraso', 'shaving', 'soap', 'merkur', 'long', 'handle', 'safety', 'razor', 'escali', 'badger', 'brush', 'perfecto', 'chrome', 'razor', 'brush', 'stand', 'nt', 'know', 'miss', 'know', 'settle', 'mediocre', 'gillette', 'shave', 'long', 'way', 'shave', 'regard', 'proraso', 'shaving', 'soap', 'specifically', 'experience', 'top', 'notch', 'send', 'remind', 'barber', 'shop', 'would', 'describe', 'almost', 'combination', 'talcum', 'powder', 'mild', 'soap', 'froth', 'well', 'numb', 'effect', 'lather', 'face', 'shave', 'cold', 'water', 'repeatedly', 'rinse', 'razor', 'numb', 'effect', 'combine', 'cold', 'steel', 'safety', 'razor', 'produce', 'soothe', 'enjoyable', 'shave', 'note', 'however', 'mended', 'rinse', 'blade', 'cold', 'water', 'suppose', 'rinse', 'warm', 'water', 'cold', 'blade', 'increase', 'chance', 'cut', 'yet', 'cut', 'though', 'merkur', 'long', 'handle', 'safety', 'razor', 'escali', 'badger', 'brush', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'respective', 'slot', 'would', 'highly', 'mend', 'product', 'well', 'strongly', 'believe', 'seller', 'continue', 'provide', 'quality', 'stand', 'comparatively', 'low', 'price', 'point', 'fair', 'well', 'product']"

The brush he's using is an vintage badger hair shaving brush that is easily 60 years old, so I was not convinced that this modern looking stand would be the right size to hold it.  It is!  This is a beautifully designed brush stand.  It is weighted so that it doesn't tip over when the brush is in place, even when there is no razor on the other side for balance.  It has a rubberized bottom that keeps it sliding around on the vanity  and it the chrome finish is easy to wipe clean.  Don't look any further, buy THIS brush stand - its that good!!

Most of the weight is in the base so it feels well balanced.

 Its weight is 8.2 oz.
 It is 6.25"" tall.
 1.5""L x 1""W arms to hold the brush
 0.75""L x 1/2""W arms to hold the raiser

My husband has been using this stand for two weeks. He said it feels like a quality product. Perfecto stand is described as chrome but based on the weight my husband thought it felt like it was made from stainless steel (this is a good thing).  He felt the brush holding side was perfect. The razor holder gives a somewhat less secure hold, it wobbles a little bit due to shape of the handle on the razor.  This is a minor quibble and overall he likes the stand.

This stand is provided by PerfectoTM.

5.0,"This handsome razor and brush stand has a beautiful chrome finish that is polished like a mirror. The pole has knurled bands that complement those on traditional safety razors. The stable, weighted base has water-resistant, non-skid padding underneath.

The stand is 6 in. tall and the base has a diameter of 2 7/8 in. Construction is very solid and it weighs in at over 8 oz.

The arms will hold both a safety razor and a badger hair shaving brush for convenience and to ensure fast drying to preserve function of blades and bristles, as well as for good hygiene. It will fit in most medicine cabinets, but is too good-looking to hide and deserves a spot on the sink where it can be seen.

5.0,"I received my stand as a review sample and was blown away by the attention to detail in the design and the construction.  Instead of gushing I'll explain why I think it's a perfect solution.

Starting with the design, this has a heavy, tip-proof base with a rubber (or perhaps neoprene) bottom. The weight and the bottom ensure that it stays put regardless of how wet your sink cabinet top becomes. Plus the forks for holding your razor and brush will fit just about any model of either.

It's the construction that I love. Heavy, chrome and the knurled part of the post is a wonderful masculine touch with a true function. It will not slip from soapy hands if you want to reposition it. I mentioned that this stand's design showed attention to detail and the knurling is a prime example.

Since it is heavily chromed it's easy to keep clean and sanitary. For me that is a major factor. Plus the post can be unscrewed from the base for thoroughly cleaning it. When the post is screwed into the base, there is no indication that it's a two piece unit. It appears to be seamless, so that is one less place for bacteria to hide.

I normally do not wax enthusiastic about something as mundane as a stand, but this one is perfect for those of us who shave the old fashioned way.",Perfect for safety razors and brushes,"['receive', 'stand', 'review', 'sample', 'blow', 'away', 'attention', 'detail', 'design', 'construction', 'instead', 'gush', 'explain', 'think', 'perfect', 'solution', 'start', 'design', 'heavy', 'tipproof', 'base', 'rubber', 'perhaps', 'neoprene', 'bottom', 'weight', 'bottom', 'ensure', 'stay', 'put', 'regardless', 'wet', 'sink', 'cabinet', 'top', 'es', 'plus', 'fork', 'hold', 'razor', 'brush', 'fit', 'model', 'either', 'construction', 'love', 'heavy', 'chrome', 'knurle', 'part', 'post', 'wonderful', 'masculine', 'touch', 'true', 'function', 'slip', 'soapy', 'hand', 'want', 'reposition', 'mention', 'stand', 'design', 'show', 'attention', 'detail', 'knurle', 'prime', 'example', 'since', 'heavily', 'chromed', 'easy', 'keep', 'clean', 'sanitary', 'major', 'factor', 'plus', 'post', 'unscrewed', 'base', 'thoroughly', 'clean', 'post', 'screw', 'base', 'indication', 'two', 'piece', 'unit', 'appear', 'seamless', 'one', 'less', 'place', 'bacteria', 'hide', 'normally', 'wax', 'enthusiastic', 'something', 'mundane', 'stand', 'one', 'perfect', '-PRON-', 'shave', 'old', 'fashioned', 'way']"

When the tree arrived I opened the box to make sure everything was there and correct. The quality of the tree inside -- color, texture, weight and realism -- was exceptional, beyond what I expected. Two years ago, I purchased a Vickerman Albany Spruce here on Amazon. It cost slightly less than the Balsam Hill, which was on an after-Christmas sale. The Vickerman does not compare in quality or appearance to the Balsam Hill. To say I am pleased with the Saratoga Spruce would be a gross understatement.

5.0,"I don't normally write reviews, but decided to do so with this Christmas tree.  We decided to replace our previous pre-lit artificial tree as some of the lights were burnt out and we couldn't replace the lights as we couldn't find that type of bulb any longer.  We wanted to go with an unlit so we wouldn't encounter this problem again.  After much research, we went with this Balsam Hill tree.  We were very happy with our selection.  It does take a bit of work to get the tree to look so full, but it was well worth the effort.  The two types of branches makes the tree look very authentic with the ""real feel"" and traditional.  This particular tree came with 3000 tips, so there is a lot to work with to make it as full as the picture.  The branches don't touch the floor once you place the stand on the tree, but this was great for us.  Our previous tree did touch, so there wasn't any way to put gifts underneath.  The hinge affect was a nice feature as you can lower them one at a time to be able to fluff each branch before releasing the next row.  The tree bag was not a cheap, trash bag type, but a very sturdy plastic with a zipper and padded handles.  There were also two sets of gloves, not one.  There were also extra bolts and washers.

5.0,"Originally I ordered my silicone baking mat from Better Brighter Ideas in July. Sadly, I had a defective mat. However, Ms. Nina B. corrected that issue and within the following week I had a new mat and a personalized note card that showed me the seller really cared about my shopping experience. Now, there was another baking mat that I've purchased that also demonstrated excellent service. Now, Better Brighter Ideas topped the customer service charts. Why? The personal note card showed an even more attention to detail for making sure that I was truly satisfied.

Pros:
-No more scrubbing a baking pan
-Easy clean-up
-No more stuck on foods
-Even distribution of cooking
-Healthier alternative to using cooking sprays and oils
-Cookies slide right off with even and browned bottom
-Bonus included (you'll have to order to find out)
-5-Year Replacement Satisfaction Guaranteed

Cons:
-I would say that occasionally the smell of your food baked on the mat will linger on (I find this happens with any silicone baking mat). However, I suggest soaking in mild, warm, sudsy water with a cap full of vinegar will stop any odors from remaining.

About the Seller:
I ordered my Silicone Baking Mat - Premium Quality Foodsafe Professional Nonstick Half Sheet Size from Better Brighter Ideas on 7/1/13 and it arrived on 7/3/13...on time and neatly packaged. Since I had a defective product, the seller replaced my product within a week or so. Additionally, the seller also sent properer verification as to when the product would be delivered and when it shipped. This gratuitous product was provided commensurate for my unbiased review and equitable opinion. Furthermore, I received follow-up emails from the seller to ensure my satisfaction. This is the way one garners the status of excellent customer service. Kudos to Ms. Nina B. for going above and beyond in my situation.

Recommendations:
To the Manufacturer: Perhaps a more brighter and fun color and design would be more attractive. Even something with your logo or branding would set you  apart from other companies as well.

To the Seller: Thank you Ms. Nina B. again for the attention to detail and the lovely personal note card you sent me. That was really appreciated. I'm sorry for the late response here (been a bit busy), but I didn't want this review to go unnoticed. Your customer service is stellar and in all the years of shopping on Amazon, I've never received a personal touch like yours. You made my day brighter indeed!

To Potential Customers: If you want great service and great products, then shop with Better Brighter Ideas.

5.0,"I ordered this Silicone Baking Mat from Easy Breezy Kitchen because I use a gas broiler and oven, which can heat up very quickly and cause food to stick, and also has hot spots that can cook food unevenly if I don't watch it.

Not only does this premium quality baking mat cook foods evenly and prevent burning and sticking to the cookie sheet, it also saves me money because I don't need to use cooking oil or non-stick sprays (and the associated chemicals) or butter (and the associated calories) to prevent food from sticking.

It also works great for making cookies, sticky dough, etc. because I don't have to use flour, wax paper, aluminum foil or parchment when kneading or rolling out the dough. What a great time and money saver!

As far as clean up, because silicone baking mats are very flexible, the are easier to wipe down or wash by hand than in the dishwasher, although they are dishwasher safe. For simple cleaning, I wipe it down or hand wash it and air dry it, which works fine. For deeper cleaning, or cleaning after broiling (fish, meatballs, etc.) I have found that soap and water work well to get the grease or drippings off.

With repeated use, it doesn't discolor, and it's working as well today as when I bought it a month ago. It doesn't lose flexibility or non-stick properties over time.

Overall, it helps me turn out really great baked goods, broiled and grilled meats, treats and other delights without adding chemicals or calories, and without worrying about hot spots in the oven, uneven baking, or ruined deserts due to sticking to the pan.

Normally even the easy cookies would not be all that much fun at night after dinner, but baking them on this silicone mat was quick with super easy cleanup. It worked perfectly and took no more than a minute or so to clean up... try doing that with a normal cookie sheet pan.

Another great thing about this mat... if you like your cookies a bit on the crispy side like we do, you can do that on the mat without worrying that you'll burn the bottoms. It's really neat the way it works.

There are many different brands of mats, but what's nice about the Better Brighter mat is that it comes with a handy card with tips for using and storing. I used one of the tips for storing the mat that I never would have thought of on my own. It also has some recipes included that look really good, haven't had a chance to try them yet.

This is the 2nd mat I've bought recently, it's a good idea to have 2 when you want to bake in batches - cookies usually require at least 2 rounds in the oven to bake the whole recipe.

5.0,"Art of Breathing, Collected Articles by Jessica Wolf

In this series of articles, Jessica Wolf writes about the Art of Breathing the way a physicist might explain the mysteries of the universe in words that the layperson can comprehend.  Her expertise has not inured her to the wonderment and brilliance of the respiratory system that is the birthright of every living being.  Jessica explains the intrinsic and synergistic nature of breathing coordination in simple yet elegant language:

 ""Oxygen is a basic necessity of life and an inexhaustible resource, filling our lungs and generating energy for our bodies.  Breathing is a most adaptable, responsive, and always available way to fuel the body by carrying oxygen into the lungs.  Breathing is ongoing; we are either letting the breath out or allowing the breath in.  We breathe new life into ourselves anywhere from eight to eighteen times a minute.  We never have to worry about our next breath; it has a quiet presence, and is in perpetual motion.  It is inspiring to know that our breath responds naturally and spontaneously to our every thought and feeling."" (1. Improve Your Green Machine).

Along with this excellent and eminently readable book, Jessica has produced a companion 3D animation DVD called the ""Rib Animation Project.""  Since the Art of Breathing book just came out this spring, it was too late to assign it to my BFA and MFA Theater students, to whom I'd been teaching Alexander Technique and the Art of Breathing all year.  But I did manage to play this short video for them.  It was exactly what they needed to allow everything they'd been learning about the respiratory system to coalesce and clarify their experience both intellectually and experientially in a way that they will not forget in the years to come.

I have been getting very little sleep, lots of caffeine,  and my skin definetly has been showing it. This cream is light and moisturizes well. I think the areas where it showed the most use was around the outside of my eyes (where crowfeet wrinkle lines would be).

So when I was offered the Jenna Jameson Heartbreaker Perfume at a reduced price in exchange for my honest review I knew I had to accept it.

However, this is one of those perfumes, at least for me, that you have to actually put on and let your own body chemistry decide on the smell. After spraying the perfume on my wrist the scent completely changed and I actually really liked the scent. The bottle is very pretty also. It's a ruby red color with two silver colored hearts on it.

It's nice that so many electric shavers on the market have all these bells and whistles, but lets get real, we only want something that shaves as good a razor.  And this shaver DOES shave like a razor without the nicks.
Points that I love about this shaver:
* Quiet
* Very close shave
* Easily and dummy proof, since it reminds you, cleaning with plain running hot water
* Good ergonomics
* Lit LCD Display with info on status of charge and cleaning time
* Semi-soft plastic stand, not the rigid plastics, just in case you knock it off the counter it won't crack.
* Carry case
Points I didn't like:
* Can't charge the shaver in the stand since the AC plug goes under the shaver.
* Norelco's are probably the most expensive shavers on the market so you are really paying for the carry case

Based on some of the other reviews, I bought the Quadra and have been happy ever since.
 Personally I've found out 2 things(just from my perspective):
1) The 2-3 week period for letting your skin getting used to the razor is TRUE. But I found just after week or so, it took me just 3-4 minutes to shave and NO burning, itching or anything.
2) As said by some others, so easy to clean you don't think it's enough.

3.0,"Since shaving is a hassle, I figured I would get the best and was persuaded by the high reviews of the Norelco 6885.  Brauns flat-head electric ravors have always been pretty much fine for me, but I was willing to try this one to try and reduce the hassle/occassional discomfort.  Admittedly, it seems solidly constructed, has a powerful motor and ""feels"" like a quality product.  It shaves fairly close, and perhaps misses fewer stray hairs then the flat-head electric razors.  It also does fairly well on the typical weekend growth.  However, on an overal closeness basis it doesn't seem superior to the better Brauns I have used.  (Braun does make some low-end shavers to avoid).  The 6885 does have some downsides - it seems to take longer to use then the better Brauns, and is certainly rougher on the face.  They say it takes 20 days to get used to it; I've had it for around 40, and its still rougher on the face then my old Braun. Nothing serious, but I have redness for a few minutes after each shave.  My bottom line is that this is a quality razor that might rate a ""4"" if it were more reasonably priced.  As it is, I would go with a nice 80 or 90 dollar Braun if I had it to do over.",Not worth the money,"['since', 'shaving', 'hassle', 'figure', 'would', 'get', 'good', 'persuade', 'high', 'review', 'norelco', 'braun', 'flathead', 'electric', 'ravor', 'always', 'pretty', 'much', 'fine', 'willing', 'try', 'one', 'try', 'reduce', 'hassleoccassional', 'fort', 'admittedly', 'seem', 'solidly', 'construct', 'powerful', 'motor', 'feel', 'like', 'quality', 'product', 'shaves', 'fairly', 'close', 'perhaps', 'miss', 'few', 'stray', 'hair', 'flathead', 'electric', 'razor', 'also', 'fairly', 'well', 'typical', 'weekend', 'growth', 'however', 'overal', 'closeness', 'basis', 'nt', 'seem', 'superior', 'well', 'braun', 'use', 'braun', 'make', 'lowend', 'shaver', 'avoid', 'downside', 'seem', 'take', 'long', 'use', 'well', 'braun', 'certainly', 'rougher', 'face', 'say', 'take', 'day', 'get', 'use', 'around', 'still', 'rougher', 'face', 'old', 'braun', 'nothing', 'serious', 'redness', 'minute', 'shave', 'bottom', 'line', 'quality', 'razor', 'may', 'rate', 'reasonably', 'price', 'would', 'go', 'nice', 'dollar', 'braun']"

5.0,"First, let's face (no pun intended) facts. NOTHING shaves as quickly or as closely as a blade. Given that starting point, however, this little beauty is probably as good as an electric gets. I have used Norelco and Braun shavers for years (with a slight detour for a Panasonic). This model Norelco gives the closest electric shave my heavy daily growth has experienced, with absolutely no razor burn nor the necessity of a ""touch up"" with a blade. It is quiet and clean-up with running water is a cinch. It takes longer than some to fully recharge, but unless you plan to stand over it for an hour, this is hardly an inconvenience. The model can be bought with an adapter for the car (which came with mine). Shaving while driving, however, may be a manifestation of a death wish and probably falls in the same category as using the cell phone while on the highway.

Despite the fact that I followed the charging instructions, after 2-3 months of usage, I can get 37-38 minutes at most.

4.0,"I was thrilled when I got my Norelco 6885XL about a month back. I read the users manual and noticed the fact that it takes at least 21 days to get used to the shaver. Although my facial hair grows very fast, I usually tend to shave once in a couple of days. Considering this, I felt I should give myself atleast 40 days to get used to the shaver. I have to tell you that I was not disappointed save for nitpicky problems! The shaver has some excellent features and a couple of could-be-better aspects. I have listed the pros and cons below.
Pros:
1. Great design - Fits perfectly in your hand.
2. LOVE the LCD - The display is great with a lot of features (backlit with minutes remaining, cleaning reminder, charge reminder etc).
3. Effective blades - The three rotating, swiveling heads are very efficient, the Quadra Action works well and the motors are extremely quiet.
4. Built-in trimmer - Works well with sideburns.
5. Cleaning - You will drop down on your knees and thank Norelco for making the shaver so easy to clean! Just hold the shaver under warm/hot water and it cleans in a jiffy! No brushes (although it is included), no blowing and getting hair in your eyes, no fear of using a shaver with a wet face, and so on. This is one of the best features, in my opinion.
6. Incredible warranty - Norelco fixes or replaces anything and everything for for two years! The warranty is so good that they replace the charger cord, brush and the protective cap even if you lose them, all for just shipping charges.
7. Nice stand to place the shaver when not in use.
Cons:
1. It takes a LONG time for the regions of the neck and chin to get used to the shaver. I am not entirely satisfied with the shave because of this, but I hope it gets better with time.
2. The 6885XL does not come with the car adapter, which is sold separately, while the 6886XL (sold at warehouse stores like Costco and Sam's Club) includes the car adapter for the same price.
3. The minutes remaning on the LCD is deceptive in the beginning as it does not display the right amount of time left. This fact was in the manual but I overlooked it. It takes about 4-5 charges for it to display the accurate time remaining for some reason. The good part is that no matter what, the shaver gets to a full 45 minute charge in barely an hour!
4. While the carry case is bulky, it is very effective in the fact that it protects the shaver well, and is cleverly designed to hold the shaver, the charger (without the big plug getting in the way) and brush.
Before I bought the shaver, I had shortlisted my choice down to two. The 6885XL and the Braun Syncro (with LCD). While both are considered equally good, people tend to overlook one main problem with the Syncro. The self-cleaning cartridges. While they are readily available now, each of them costs around $10 and last for a month with average shaving. This means you have to invest $10 a month to keep the shaver clean or risk getting the blades dull. The Norelco has easy cleaning, and no added charges after the purchase except for new blades every year.
Finally, I gave it 4 stars only because of my problem with the effectiveness of the shaver in the neck regions. I am hoping that gets better soon and I don't have to use a regular razor to shave for the finishing touches. I strongly recommend the Norelco 6885XL (better yet, 6886XL). You won't be disappointed.

4.0,"I was concerned about spending this much for a razor. ... After using this for about a week now, I feel that it was a good investment.  It gives a nice clean, smooth shave.

The heads adjust to your face much better.  I also like the fact that the batteries can be replaced much easier. On previous models, the batteries were soldered in and they were a pain to replace.
One negative comment: The case on this is huge.  It probably takes up 3 times as much space as my old Norelco did.  Most of the extra space is taken up by the cord that has electronics built into it to adapt between 110 and 220 volts.

2.0,"I bought this razor a month ago, because I thought I could save time with a fast, electric shave. It has always been a pain for me to wake up every morning a couple of minutes earlier just so that I could soak my face in hot water to get a closer shave. After arriving to work late a couple of times, due to the long process of soaking/shaving in the morning, I thought it was time for an electric. I used my friend's Braun razor on which he spent 50 bucks, but I found the closeness of Braun to be around 80 percent to that of a blade. So I was thinking by spending 150 bucks on Norelco's top-of-the-line razor, that I would have a nice quick & easy shave in the morning comparable to my blade. Boy was I wrong!
Norelco states in their manuals that you should use their shavers for 21 days straight. After a week, I noticed that the skin around my neck started to turn red. My friends would laugh at me because I literally had a ""red-neck"". Then I would use after-shave thinking that would work. But by the second week, my skin was so irritated that it broke out into a rash. I didn't even make the 21 days. I thought to myself, ""was worth it to spend 150 bucks so that my neck could break out into a rash?"" Obviously it wasn't.

I tried this unit for a week having used a braun unit before that, and I really had to works at cutting everything which irritated my face a bit...(and my face doesn't irritate easily)  Besides having to work more, those three big heads impress me as having too much surface area to be rubbing on your face at once which just adds to irritation.

5.0,"First, a little background.  I've switched between Norelco electric razors and blades over the years, never quite satisfied with the shave I was getting.  Norelco has always said ""shaves as close as a blade or your money back"".  I've never found this to be true, but the razors were good enough that I didn't return them.  Most recently I used the Gilette Mach 3 razor which does a very good job.
Now here's why I give the 6885XL (6886XL is apparently the same model, sold at Costco and other warehouse stores) 5 stars:
- Closest shave yet.  This is the first electric razor I've used that shaves as close as a blade (including the Mach 3).  In fact, it shaves closer than a blade under my jaw and around my adam's apple.  I can't shave against the grain with a blade in those areas or my skin breaks out (and that's the only way to get the closest shave.)  With the 6885XL I don't have this problem and I get a really close shave.
- It's quiet.  Previous electric razors were so noisy I had to shave in another bathroom so I wouldn't wake my wife.  Not so with this one.
- Easy to clean.  Open the top and run hot water through it.  No more brushes (except for periodic maintenance).  An indicator will tell you when it's time to clean.
Other features:
- Charge remaining (in minutes) display.  This isn't particularly useful to me, but it seems reasonable accurate.
- It comes with a stand that holds the razor upright on the counter or basin.  Much neater than the razor just laying around or stuffed in a cabinet.
- Hard carrying case, for travel.

5.0,"I recently purchased the new Braun Syncro, and compared it side-by-side with my roommate's Norelco 6885.  In fact, I switched back and forth for a few days to make sure I wasn't being biased in any way. For me, the Norelco was much better.  They both give you a suprisingly close shave, but the Norelco just captured more hair in an easier manner around my neck.  I would only recommend the Braun to those who have extremely consistent hair growth (all growing in one direction), which I would think is not very common.  In my case, I just ordered my own Norelco 6885 today and packaging my Braun Syncro tonight for a return.",Better than Braun Syncro,"['recently', 'purchase', 'new', 'braun', 'syncro', 'compare', 'sidebyside', 'roommate', 'norelco', 'fact', 'switch', 'back', 'forth', 'day', 'make', 'sure', 'nt', 'biased', 'way', 'norelco', 'much', 'well', 'give', 'suprisingly', 'close', 'shave', 'norelco', 'capture', 'hair', 'easy', 'manner', 'around', 'neck', 'would', 'mend', 'braun', 'extremely', 'consistent', 'hair', 'growth', 'grow', 'one', 'direction', 'would', 'think', 'common', 'case', 'order', 'norelco', 'today', 'packaging', 'braun', 'syncro', 'tonight', 'return']"
5.0,"I have been using this razor for approx. one month.  Before this I used a Braun foil type razor.  However, the Braun razor always seemed to miss a few whiskers, especially after a couple of days of not shaving, and I would just end up using a straight razor once a week.  The Norelco razor gives a very close shave and manages to get my entire beard even after a few days of not shaving.  I suspect the rotary blades are what makes the difference.  I need to charge the Norelco once a week and each charge lasts for approx. 40 minutes (45 min is advertised but this is the max possible).  Charging takes approx one hour (but I never really timed it).  There is also a quick charge feature where you can have about 3 minutes shaving in about the same amount (3 minutes) of charge time.  Another nice feature of this razor is that it is quiet - much more quiet than my foil razor.  Also, the 6000 series allows the razor to be cleaned by rinsing in water.  This is nice since the first thing I did was to loose the little brush for cleaning the foil razor.  I ended up banging it on the side of the wash basin (not good) and making a big whisker mess.  One other nice feature of the Norelco is there is no switch to flip for European voltage since it converts automatically.  Antoher tip is that you may want to review the Norelco web site to get a good comparison of all the different series.  You may want to go with a slightly cheaper version if you do not need all the LCD displays or the water washable feature or the fancy carrying case.

For several years I used one of the Norelco shavers (three round ""heads"") and never knew better.  But when you switch to a Braun, you realize how much closer the shave is.  The pivoting head adjusts to face's contours much better than the Norelco which is sorta' clunky and BIG.

4.0,"I can't rave enough about the Braun Syncro!  It is the best shave I've ever gotten out of an electric.  I will say that the blade is still closer, but you get 95% there without the mess or skin irritation.  The biggest advantage is that you never have to clean or oil it manually.  Just drop it into the Clean & Charge base and forget about it.  It is always clean and ready to go!  This unit also has the longest charge-hold that I've ever seen.  I only need 3-4 minutes to shave each day, so the shaver only has to charge about once every 2 weeks!  There is one drawback that I have found:  The unavailability of the cleaning cartridges.  Hardly anyone carries this little cartridge.  I visited the large retailers in my areaincluding Wal-Mart, Target, and K-Mart and no one carries it.  A Target employee said they did carry them, but wouldn't be stocking them anymore.

The batteries last for more then a week of daily shaving, and it runs at full power until the last minute. The display tells you exactly how much shaving time you have left (and it is accurate). The cleaning feature is just the best. No need to use brushes anymore and it always feels fresh and smooth. It even cuts through a long weekend beard with ease. I love it.

5.0,"I have extremely thick facial hair, and before using the Braun 7570 I tried almost every other product I could think of in the hopes of getting a close shave, while not sacrificing pints of blood along with it.  Previously I had used a Panasonic wet/dry electric shaver with shaving cream, which gave me a decently close shave, but ended up getting so gunked up with the shaving cream that it would become useless after a month or so.  I then went on to shaving with the Mach 3, and after using the most expensive of creams, aftershaves, and toners, I would still find my face a bloody mess in the morning, especially my neck.  I looked around online and was instantly attracted to the Braun.  I am pleased to say that it does everything that is advertized.  The shaves are clean and quick, and you don't have to worry about the blade dulling after repeated use because of the self-cleaning process.  I do have to say that I recently took the shaver on a two-week trip without the cleaning stand, and I found that even though the machine would tell me when to clean it with the included brush, the shaves would become progressively more painful and less effective.  So those of you thinking about not spending the extra money on a Syncro model with the Clean and Charge Stand, I would recommend reconsidering your options.  This is the component that I have found that makes the product so wonderful.

No more nicks or cuts from blades and much more efficient and faster than the other electrics and I shave a lot both the face and the dome.

5.0,"OK, I'll admit it....I'm lazy. One day I just got really tired of shaving with a blade, not to mention all the money I was throwing away on all the Mach3 junk. I spent about a month researching electric shavers, usually shocked at what some of them actually cost.  For that month, I shaved with a beard trimmer (Ouch!).  Of course it didn't get very close, but I wasn't expecting much more from an electric shaver...boy was I wrong! It came X-Mas time and I decided to ask for the most expensive best-reviewed shaver I could find.  I quickly found the Braun Syncro 7570. First of all, the shaver itself is perfect.  I had never believed that ""close as blade"" stuff they've been saying for 10 years, but it really is true.  This thing literally shaved as close as a blade, without any irritation or cuts (of course). Second, it is smart.  It knows more about shaving than I do.  It will end up needing less care than most of the things I own. Cleaning is fast, complete, and efficient...the LCD even inverts itself when turned upside down in the cleaning unit so you can still read it.

5.0,"I shaved with a blade for 23 years (new airport security rules eliminating sharp items in carry-ons caused me to try this shaver).  When I first started shaving, I tried an electic foil razor, but it left me shaver burned and I never tried again until recently purchasing this shaver.
This is truly an example of how technology over more than two decades has improved.  This shaver provides a close shave without the burn, and the automatic cleaning system works exceptionally well.  I couldn't even match the performance of the automated cleaning system when performing the exercise manually with the supplied brush.  No patience, I guess.
I still haven't decided whether to clean daily or less frequently even after referencing the other reviews on this site.  I am committed to performing the cleanings at the frequency needed to keep the quality of the shave at the same level that it is now, but I do not think this is daily even with the limited experience that I have had to this point.
As the instruction manual suggests, it is best to shave against the grain of the whiskers.  While this is intuitively obvious, I believe blade shaving is a little more forgiving when not actually following the grain.  The Braun will audibly give you a good indication of whether you are actually against the grain by whether you hear the hairs being shaven or not.  If you know you are not clean-shaven in a region, try a different angle to shaving until you ""hear"" the Braun performing the cutting.  With some time, you will come to know the ""contour"" of the grain on your face and shaving with the Braun will be as natural as shaving with a blade but with even better performance.",Is it Time to Switch from Blade to Braun?,"['shave', 'blade', 'year', 'new', 'airport', 'security', 'rule', 'eliminate', 'sharp', 'item', 'carryon', 'cause', 'try', 'shaver', 'first', 'start', 'shaving', 'try', 'electic', 'foil', 'razor', 'left', 'shaver', 'burn', 'never', 'try', 'recently', 'purchase', 'shaver', 'truly', 'example', 'technology', 'two', 'decade', 'improve', 'shaver', 'provide', 'close', 'shave', 'without', 'burn', 'automatic', 'clean', 'system', 'work', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'could', 'nt', 'even', 'match', 'performance', 'automate', 'clean', 'system', 'perform', 'exercise', 'manually', 'supply', 'brush', 'patience', 'guess', 'still', 'nt', 'decide', 'whether', 'clean', 'daily', 'less', 'frequently', 'even', 'reference', 'review', 'site', 'committed', 'perform', 'cleaning', 'frequency', 'need', 'keep', 'quality', 'shave', 'level', 'think', 'daily', 'even', 'limited', 'experience', 'point', 'instruction', 'manual', 'suggest', 'good', 'shave', 'grain', 'whisker', 'intuitively', 'obvious', 'believe', 'blade', 'shaving', 'little', 'forgiving', 'actually', 'follow', 'grain', 'braun', 'audibly', 'give', 'good', 'indication', 'whether', 'actually', 'grain', 'whether', 'hear', 'hair', 'shaven', 'know', 'cleanshaven', 'region', 'try', 'different', 'angle', 'shaving', 'hear', 'braun', 'perform', 'cut', 'time', 'come', 'know', 'contour', 'grain', 'face', 'shaving', 'braun', 'natural', 'shaving', 'blade', 'even', 'well', 'performance']"

3.0,"Ok, don't get my wrong. The quality of this razor is very good, but it has one MAJOR drawback and one minor one. Everyone talks about the cleaning stand which I also agree is very neat and does a good job of cleaning the razor, but the problem is neck hair. If you look at any of the consumer bulletin boards, you'll see the same complaint over and over. This thing simply doesn't trim long hair that runs flat at the neck line (or for that matter any long hairs). You must use the beard trimmer to get these and that really doesn't work well either. The other minor complaint is that this that this thing is VERY loud. Shaving around the sideburn area close to your ear is just uncomfortable because the razor is so loud (not to mention waking up your wife early in the morning).

4.0,"I haven't tried all that many electrics, but this is definitely the closest shave I've gotten with one. However, there is some truth to the fact that it is a little harder to use than a rotary. The reason is simply that the Braun MUST be used against the grain of your hair (the direction of which changes all over your face) whereas a rotary is perfecty symetric and it doesn't matter. When used correctly, which means learning your particular face patterns, there is little argument that the Braun will shave closer than any rotary, as a foil can be made much thinner than a rotary ""cage."" In fact, the very closeness of the shave is why some people are complaining about ingrown hairs. There shaver does have definite difficulty with long, flat-lying hairs, perhaps even more so than other electrics, which is its only significant problem in my opinion. The cleaning system is actually incredibly effective, and leaves the razor perfectly clean and lubricated. The complaints about dirty alcohol are not warranted, as alcohol is a disinfectant and all solid materials settle into traps at the bottom of the container (and aren't pulled into the stream of reciprocating alcohol). Quite clever! The only other negative is that the ergonomics of the device could be much better, especially relative to Norelco products. All in all, I'm very happy with my unit; regardless of some of the negatives I can get an excellent shave in the quickest amount of time of any of the alternatives I've ever tried (which includes blades).","Not perfect, but the best electric I've owned","['nt', 'try', 'many', 'electric', 'definitely', 'close', 'shave', 'get', 'one', 'however', 'truth', 'fact', 'little', 'hard', 'use', 'rotary', 'reason', 'simply', 'braun', 'must', 'use', 'grain', 'hair', 'direction', 'change', 'face', 'whereas', 'rotary', 'perfecty', 'symetric', 'nt', 'matter', 'use', 'correctly', 'mean', 'learn', 'particular', 'face', 'pattern', 'little', 'argument', 'braun', 'shave', 'close', 'rotary', 'foil', 'make', 'much', 'thin', 'rotary', 'cage', 'fact', 'closeness', 'shave', 'people', 'complain', 'ingrown', 'hair', 'shaver', 'definite', 'difficulty', 'long', 'flatlye', 'hair', 'perhaps', 'even', 'electric', 'significant', 'problem', 'opinion', 'clean', 'system', 'actually', 'incredibly', 'effective', 'leave', 'razor', 'perfectly', 'clean', 'lubricate', 'complaint', 'dirty', 'alcohol', 'warrant', 'alcohol', 'disinfectant', 'solid', 'material', 'settle', 'trap', 'bottom', 'container', 'nt', 'pull', 'stream', 'reciprocate', 'alcohol', 'quite', 'clever', 'negative', 'ergonomic', 'device', 'could', 'much', 'well', 'especially', 'relative', 'norelco', 'product', 'happy', 'unit', 'regardless', 'negative', 'get', 'excellent', 'shave', 'quick', 'amount', 'time', 'alternative', 'ever', 'try', 'include', 'blade']"

2.0,"I bought this razor based on the rave reviews it received here.  Well, I guess you can say I'm half impressed with it since it does a good job on half of the shave.  For the upper part of may face it does a great job, better than my Norelco 5825 XL.  It shaves much easier, quicker, and closer.  However, for the lower part, under my chin and the neck area I find it very difficult to shave.  I would actually use my Norelco for the lower part and the Braun for the upper part.  Either I'm not skilled enough with this type of razor technology or its just not very easy to use on the lower part of the shave.  I suspect its the former, but maybe others have this problem too.
Another note, the display began showing ""garbage"" and has never returned to normal.  This was after only a few uses.
Other features such as the display (when it worked) and the self cleaning were great and I wish my Norelco had them.

This gives a fast and close shave that the rotary system cannot match. First three shaves are done and still no sign of any irritation at all. With any electric shaver, the first few shaves are a big mess on your face; not so with the Braun. Ni-MH batteries are a big plus as I do not have to worry about the memory effect. Neat and sylish looks are extra brownie points.

My beard is completely self willed.  In some placed it's thin, and in others, heavy.  It grows up, down, east and west with abandon, but little logic.

It includes the ultimate toy for the lazy man, a storage stand that cleans and charges the razor.  And the first LCD panel on a razor.  This not only tells you charge level and reminds you about maintenance, it provides part numbers for the head.  No doubt the next model will include an interface to your Palm V that will record blood pressure and heart rate.  If anyone could do it, it would be Braun.
Seriously, the 7570 is a superb piece if precision machinery that does exactly what it was designed to perfectly.

So I asked for an exchange, which came quickly. The exchange set was exactly like the first and made the same racket. I sent it back for a refund. I don't care what the box says, I did NOT get the correct blades. Someone has packaged the wrong blades in the HQ5 box. I will order elsewhere.

4.0,"Over my lifetime I have had several other brands of electric shavers that provided 'acceptable' shaving closeness and lasting ability of the non-replaceable battery.  It was time for yet another razor as my Remington's battery had finally died.
This was several years ago when I first saw the <b>Braun 7525 Syncro Shaver System with Clean & Charge Refills</b>, I had to purchase it right on the spot.
My first save with my new Braun Syncro Shaving System was the very best I had ever had with an electric shaver.  But I wondered, ""How long with this cutter provide a terrific result before it would be time to replace the cutting system"".  Would the foil last a month, three months ore have to be replaced every six months to a year?  Four months later I was still getting the same level of closeness as the very firsts have.  This is because the tiny hairs, dirt, and facial grease are never allowed to clog the pours in the foil or the cutter.
One week passed and I realized that I was HOOKED on the built-in cleaning feature.  As life would have it, the solution ran out, now was time to replace the cleaning cartridge.  <b>OUCH</b>, these things are expensive!
At these prices, a solution had to be found so that I (everyone) could stay out of the poor house.  So I started to look for discount and generic cartridges in stores and over the Internet with no such luck.  What else could I do but go ahead and pay those outrageous prices?  NO.  So I kept look for another solution to the problem at hand.  It did not take long to figure out how to refill the cartridge thus saving me money!  Below is the Easy Eight Step System to saving money you need to look inside the cartridge to see how much dirt, grease, and hair is in there.  Do this by taking the cartridge out of the cleaning station and then look through the holes on the top of the cartridge.
If the cartridge if completely full of hair and dirt, most likely you will have no option but to purchase a new cartridge. Of course, you could try the following steps and maybe you will gain some additional use before a replacement becomes required. poor any remaining solution down the sink by gently shaking the cartridge several ways. Don't rofget to protect your eyes when doing this. fill the cartridge with some warm water. It is best to use purified or reverse osmosis water, found in many stores for a dollar or so.  USE WATER ONLY, gently swish the water back and forth for a few minutes.  This will remove most of the facial grease and loosen the hair attached to the sponge-like dirt collector at the bottom of the cartridge
, poor the water from the cartridge down the sink drain.  Inspect the dirt collector to decide if additional cleaning with water is needed.  Do this until you are satisfied with the level of cleanliness or conclude only a new replacement cartridge in needed. NEVER use anything other that water to clean the dirt collector
, Once cleaned, shake the cartridge to remove any remaining water from inside.  Put the cartridge upside-down on a folded paper towel and let the cartridge sit for a few hours.  Then turn the cartridge upside right and let sit for a day or two until full dry on the inside
, Fill the dry cleaning cartridge with Isopropyl alcohol between  and  up to the top. If you wish you cn add a few drops of real lemon juice to cover the smell of the alcohol and possible aid in the dissolving of facial grease Step Eight and Final Step. Place the cleaned and refilled cleaning cartridge in to the cleaning station and start using and enjoying the savings.
I hope this helps everyone as this refilling method may become our only option should Braun discontinue the offering of new cleaning cartridges. Let's hope not!
I wish you many more close, clean,and comfortable shaves using your Braun Syncro Shaver System. ----Michael, Florida, USA

1.0,"I bought this razor to replace a braun razor I had used for 20 years. The rechargeable battery in the old razor finally gave out and it was going to cost me more to replace it than I would pay for a new razor. So I figure why not get a new one. Well... I got the new razor, a model 3612,  and after about 2 weeks, a part fell out of the cutter block while cleaning it. I figured I was too rough with cleaning, so I ordered a new one (almost as much as the razor) well.. it breaks the same way. I called Braun and all they would do would be to send me another foil/cutter block. I asked if they had no intention of standing behind their product and they said only to the extent of sending me another cutter block just like the 2 I had already been through. I would NOT buy any razor from this 3600 series again and I would NOT recommend anyone else buying one either.

5.0,"Well, I don't know what the other folks are complaining about. You have to periodically replace the cutting parts of a razor, yes, and according to Consumer Reports, this isn't an exorbitant price.
I'm not sure why the other fellow's foil broke twice in a year. I know it's a customer service nightmare when you get two defective items in a row, but if the foil broke even once within a year under normal use, then I have to assume it was just bad luck. I've had the cutting foil break on Braun razors, but only after I'd been using them for too long (I didn't know until today that I could order parts online, so I've tended to put off a trip to the ""nearest"" parts store) or after I'd dropped the razor.
I've had four Braun razors. The first lasted seven or eight years (with replaced foil, cutting block, AND battery; finally started overheating). The second was an inexpensive corded model, and I got tired of the cord. The third was a Flex Integral, which was fancier than I needed but worked just fine; the foil broke (from overuse) and I needed a working razor right away, so I ran out and bought a 3612, which I liked even better.

5.0,"This review is for the 3612 shaver, because I cannot rate the replacement foil/cutter.
In the 15 years I have owned them (I have 2) I have only once replaced the foil, and never replaced the blades.  The foil tore because once after cleaning I failed to snap BOTH sides of the head into place.  The next time I shaved, the blades were not able to float against the foil (because it was at a relative angle), and tore it up.
I replaced the rechargeable batteries once a few years ago, for about $3 each.
I clean the blades EVERY time I use it.  I have almost no bristles left on the cleaning brushes.
I still get as good a shave as I did about 3-4 months after they were new (I use one for travel and one at home, and swap them regularly).
I used to use a shaver lubricant spray, but haven't in the last 10 years and it doesn't seem to make a difference.
I am, however, examining options for my next 15-year shaver purchase, as some of the basic parts are wearing out.  There are a couple of small plastic parts that sometimes pop out when I'm cleaning, and at some point I'm going to lose one down the drain.

I use the razor off and on, supplementing shaving with a standard blade.  Despite what Steve in Idaho says, I'm fairly confident I wasn't pressing too hard, and I suspect the other 7 reviewers before me that have reported similar problems weren't either.  Having worked in product development for over fifteen years, 8 out of 9 responses on this forum alone reporting failures is completely unacceptable from a product reliability perspective.  However, from Braun's money making perspective, it makes great sense - if people keep buying replacement foils that is.

I love the size, and it gives a nice shave, but go ahead and spend a little more upfront to get a more reliable product.  $30 for the razor is a good deal, but $40 for replacement foils in a year isn't.","Again, the foil gives out... for a second time!","['razor', 'year', 'replace', 'foil', 'first', 'month', 'second', 'foil', 'buy', 'fail', 'recently', 'say', 'disappointed', 'product', 'wo', 'nt', 'replace', 'second', 'foil', 'look', 'new', 'well', 'design', 'razor', 'use', 'razor', 'supplementing', 'shaving', 'standard', 'blade', 'despite', 'steve', 'idaho', 'say', 'fairly', 'confident', 'nt', 'press', 'hard', 'suspect', 'reviewers', 'report', 'similar', 'problem', 'nt', 'either', 'work', 'product', 'development', 'fifteen', 'year', 'response', 'forum', 'alone', 'report', 'failure', 'completely', 'unacceptable', 'product', 'reliability', 'perspective', 'however', 'braun', 'money', 'make', 'perspective', 'make', 'great', 'sense', 'people', 'keep', 'buy', 'replacement', 'foil', 'love', 'size', 'give', 'nice', 'shave', 'go', 'ahead', 'spend', 'little', 'upfront', 'get', 'reliable', 'product', 'razor', 'good', 'deal', 'replacement', 'foil', 'year', 'nt']"

5.0,"After reading the reviews at Amazon.com and at a site that reviews electric razors, I choose the Braun 6520.  It was rated high and its price was half of the leading razor.  I also crossed check the price against other retailers and Amazon.com was [less expensive] and shipped one day sooner.
I have a tough beard that grows fast coupled with a tender face.  My Remington 300 was the first razor to allow me to use an electric shaver and make it through the day without looking like a beatnik; however, after 5 years the screens are impossible to find so it was time for a new shaver.  The new Braun came as advertised and was charged up the very first time in only 4 hours versus 14 for my old 300.  The charged and low charge lights are handy and the ability to charge a dead razor for a shave in 3 minutes is a great advantage.  I have found in the past that a preshave liquid improves the closeness of the shave and that has been true with the Braun as well.  By the third day my face had adjusted to the shaver and I am getting the closest shave ever with no skin irritation.  The shaver also does a great job with neck hairs and the occasional long hair.  One significant reason that I selected this razor was the changing of the screen and cutters at 18 months.  My old 300 required a screen or screen/cutter replacement every 6 months so this saves $30 over that 18 month period.  When selecting a razor be sure to pay attention to this or any ""self-cleaning"" liquids that you have to purchase on a regular basis.  The 6520 uses a floating head but is switchable to lock the head for hard areas like under the nose.  I found that I still get the best shave by moving my hand against the grain of the hair before I run the shaver there and you will want to shave against the grain too.  This was required with my old 300 and is indicative of most foil razors.  This is not required of rotary shavers but most research that I read indicates that a foil provides a closer shave.

So, for 3 yrs I have never used the cleaning solution, and only popped the top off  to rinse out the whisker build up, on average once a month, then let it sit out to dry by the next mornings shave. I have to tell ya, it still shaves just as good as it did 3 yrs ago! The razor part never rusted after 3 yrs of rinsing it out with water once a month.
So, my point is, if one has become obsessed with using the cleaning system, don't worry if you never get around to it, you'll still be fine if you only rinse it out with water occasionally. Still shaves great after 3 yrs!",Cleaning it frequently with the solution vs Never using the cleaner at all.,"['interesting', 'glad', 'stumble', 'across', 'braun', 'razor', 'clean', 'product', 'read', 'buy', 'braun', 'series', 'razor', 'yrs', 'ago', 'sure', 'think', 'back', 'take', 'razor', 'box', 'plug', 'store', 'box', 'away', 'leave', 'razor', 'holder', 'clean', 'solution', 'never', 'access', 'yrs', 'never', 'use', 'clean', 'solution', 'pop', 'top', 'rinse', 'whisker', 'build', 'average', 'month', 'let', 'sit', 'dry', 'next', 'morning', 'shave', 'tell', 'ya', 'still', 'shaves', 'good', 'yrs', 'ago', 'razor', 'part', 'never', 'rust', 'yrs', 'rinse', 'water', 'month', 'point', 'one', 'e', 'obsess', 'use', 'clean', 'system', 'nt', 'worry', 'never', 'get', 'around', 'still', 'fine', 'rinse', 'water', 'occasionally', 'still', 'shaves', 'great', 'yrs']"

5.0,"Caution:
Norelco tells you to replace the heads every 12 months, however, that can be excessive in some situations. If you use your Advantage shaver in a dry mode (without lubricant), then replacing the heads yearly is about accurate. However, what Norelco doesn't tell you (and the reason why most people buy an Advantage) is that if you use this shaver when your face is warm, wet, and with a lubricant (i.e. shaving in the shower) then you can easily go 2 years without replacing the cutters.

The reason for this is because dry shaving with an electric razor is extremely hard on any blade (not just these ones). By warming and wetting your face and whiskers with water and a lubricant (there are many to choose from), you can decrease blade wear by about 60%! It's also more gentle on your face and can prevent/decrease razor burn.

Skin Care Tip:
If you're concerned about healthy skin, skin cancer, and/or want to keep your skin looking young as you get older, it's best to apply an after shave lotion on your entire face with SPF shortly after the shave, while your pores are still open. You also need to apply it every day, not just on days that you shave. Pay the extra and get an after shave lotion with SPF and NOT a big bottle of generic sun block; you just might end up smelling like coconuts. The lotion can be a little pricey when you see the size of the bottle you get for your money, but just remember what your buying it for. And lastly, and this is VERY important, make sure that it blocks both UVA and UVB; not all of them do.",Replacement Interval and Skin Care,"['caution', 'norelco', 'tell', 'replace', 'head', 'every', 'month', 'however', 'excessive', 'situation', 'use', 'advantage', 'shaver', 'dry', 'mode', 'without', 'lubricant', 'replace', 'head', 'yearly', 'accurate', 'however', 'norelco', 'nt', 'tell', 'reason', 'people', 'buy', 'advantage', 'use', 'shaver', 'face', 'warm', 'wet', 'lubricant', 'ie', 'shaving', 'shower', 'easily', 'go', 'year', 'without', 'replace', 'cutter', 'reason', 'dry', 'shaving', 'electric', 'razor', 'extremely', 'hard', 'blade', 'one', 'warm', 'wetting', 'face', 'whisker', 'water', 'lubricant', 'many', 'choose', 'decrease', 'blade', 'wear', 'also', 'gentle', 'face', 'preventdecrease', 'razor', 'burn', 'skin', 'care', 'tip', 'concerned', 'healthy', 'skin', 'skin', 'cancer', 'andor', 'want', 'keep', 'skin', 'look', 'young', 'get', 'old', 'good', 'apply', 'shave', 'lotion', 'entire', 'face', 'spf', 'shortly', 'shave', 'pore', 'still', 'open', 'also', 'need', 'apply', 'every', 'day', 'day', 'shave', 'pay', 'extra', 'get', 'shave', 'lotion', 'spf', 'big', 'bottle', 'generic', 'sun', 'block', 'may', 'end', 'smell', 'like', 'coconut', 'lotion', 'little', 'pricey', 'see', 'size', 'bottle', 'get', 'money', 'remember', 'buy', 'lastly', 'important', 'make', 'sure', 'blocks', 'uva', 'uvb']"

They do work quite well with the Braun electric shaver, but you have to replace them too often. I have little growth and couldn't grow a beard even if I tried, but I still shave daily because I like the clean shaven look. I would have to replace these almost every month to keep my shaver in tip top shape.

My recommendations for making this last longer are:
1. Open the shaver up and try and clean it the best you can first. Your shaver probably came with a little brush. Use that to get all the bigger pieces out first
2. When your cartridge is really gross and the indicator says it needs to be replaced, dump out all the solution. The cartridge doesn't allow you to get it completely empty, but do your best. Then fill with regular water and continue to use. This method will let you get a few more cleans in before having to pop in a new cartridge. It's not the same, but it's better than paying for so many refills.",Add your own solution to make these last longer!,"['reason', 'perfect', 'five', 'star', 'price', 'nt', 'think', 'warrant', 'price', 'work', 'quite', 'well', 'braun', 'electric', 'shaver', 'replace', 'often', 'little', 'growth', 'could', 'nt', 'grow', 'beard', 'even', 'try', 'still', 'shave', 'daily', 'like', 'clean', 'shaven', 'look', 'would', 'replace', 'almost', 'every', 'month', 'keep', 'shaver', 'tip', 'top', 'shape', 'mendation', 'make', 'last', 'long', 'open', 'shaver', 'try', 'clean', 'good', 'first', 'shaver', 'probably', 'come', 'little', 'brush', 'use', 'get', 'big', 'piece', 'first', 'cartridge', 'really', 'gross', 'indicator', 'say', 'need', 'replace', 'dump', 'solution', 'cartridge', 'nt', 'allow', 'get', 'completely', 'empty', 'good', 'fill', 'regular', 'water', 'continue', 'use', 'method', 'let', 'get', 'cleans', 'pop', 'new', 'cartridge', 'well', 'pay', 'many', 'refill']"

1.0,This product is worthless.  It is very difficult to grasp a hair with the tweezers.  And my fingers got cramps pressing and holding the tweezers tight enough to keep the light on bright for the three minutes.  The patches also did not work at all.

These can be made to last quite a while. I read a review a long time ago that offered
one piece of advice I've been using now, for 3 years.
Keep the cap for the cartridge close to your cleaning station. And when you take your
razor. Pull the cartridge out of the cleaning station and put the cap back on. This helps
the cartridge last a long time. And the fluid remains effective even when it starts to change
color. You can get two or three months easily. I only clean my razor every third day. And I
get more than three months out of a cartridge.",Here's how to get extra milage out of these great cartridges.,"['work', 'well', 'leave', 'razor', 'clean', 'nice', 'scent', 'make', 'last', 'quite', 'read', 'review', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'offer', 'one', 'piece', 'advice', 'use', 'year', 'keep', 'cap', 'cartridge', 'close', 'clean', 'station', 'take', 'razor', 'pull', 'cartridge', 'clean', 'station', 'put', 'cap', 'back', 'help', 'cartridge', 'last', 'long', 'time', 'fluid', 'remain', 'effective', 'even', 'start', 'change', 'color', 'get', 'two', 'three', 'month', 'easily', 'clean', 'razor', 'every', 'third', 'day', 'get', 'three', 'month', 'cartridge']"

5.0,"So I have a Braun shaver. At first I thought I couldn't justify the costs of these cartridges because you can buy generic liquid on eBay for far cheaper. So I bought the eBay alternatives and they don't come close. Some key points:

Generic Stuff:
1. You have to mix with water and make your own solution
2. You have to reuse these cartridges
3. The liquid is much ""wetter"" which results in a wet blade even after cleaning is complete. This is a very bad thing.
4. Smell isn't nearly as good.
5. Doesn't clean as well

5.0,"The good news is that since these cleaning refill cartridges are made by the manufacturer, they are an exact fit, and they work just the way the original cartridge does. However, there are a couple of things to think about:

Braun's manual says to run the cleaning cycle every day. In reality, cleaning it every week works just as well; I can't detect any difference between every-day and weekly cleaning. As one reviewer notes, the cleaning liquid evaporates whether or not you run the cycle, but the simple fact is that the cartridge will run out sooner if you run the cleaning cycle every day. I remove the cartridge and put the cap on between uses and that helps a lot.

You could just clean the Braun with the little cleaning brush. But what's the point of buying a shaver with an automatic cleaning system, then not using it?

There are two bits of bad news. First is the cost. These things are very pricey; if you clean every day, and if a cartridge lasts about 30 cleanings, you'll spend about $60 per year. That's just the way it goes. You could easily pour the cheap or even home-brew cleaner of your choice into the empty cartridge, but that would be a VERY bad idea. Whatever you put in won't have the lubricants that the factory liquid does, and that will cause your replaceable but expensive cutter head to wear out faster. In addition, some cleaners would probably damage the machine.

Another bit of bad news is the mess. You have to pry off two plastic lids then slide the brim-full cartridge into the cleaning base. It is VERY difficult to do so without spilling some of the fluid.

Having said all of that, though, the fact is that if you want to use the Braun shaver to its full potential, you have to buy these cartridges. So be careful and don't spill.","These are made to fit, and so perfectly.","['good', 'news', 'since', 'clean', 'refill', 'cartridge', 'make', 'manufacturer', 'exact', 'fit', 'work', 'way', 'original', 'cartridge', 'however', 'couple', 'thing', 'think', 'braun', 'manual', 'say', 'run', 'clean', 'cycle', 'every', 'day', 'reality', 'clean', 'every', 'week', 'work', 'well', 'ca', 'nt', 'detect', 'difference', 'everyday', 'weekly', 'clean', 'one', 'reviewer', 'note', 'clean', 'liquid', 'evaporate', 'whether', 'run', 'cycle', 'simple', 'fact', 'cartridge', 'run', 'soon', 'run', 'clean', 'cycle', 'every', 'day', 'remove', 'cartridge', 'put', 'cap', 'use', 'help', 'lot', 'could', 'clean', 'braun', 'little', 'clean', 'brush', 'point', 'buy', 'shaver', 'automatic', 'clean', 'system', 'use', 'two', 'bits', 'bad', 'news', 'first', 'cost', 'thing', 'pricey', 'clean', 'every', 'day', 'cartridge', 'last', 'cleaning', 'spend', 'per', 'year', 'way', 'go', 'could', 'easily', 'pour', 'cheap', 'even', 'homebrew', 'clean', 'choice', 'empty', 'cartridge', 'would', 'bad', 'idea', 'whatever', 'put', 'wo', 'nt', 'lubricant', 'factory', 'liquid', 'cause', 'replaceable', 'expensive', 'cutter', 'head', 'wear', 'fast', 'addition', 'cleaner', 'would', 'probably', 'damage', 'machine', 'another', 'bit', 'bad', 'news', 'mess', 'pry', 'two', 'plastic', 'lid', 'slide', 'brimfull', 'cartridge', 'clean', 'base', 'difficult', 'without', 'spilling', 'fluid', 'say', 'though', 'fact', 'want', 'use', 'braun', 'shaver', 'full', 'potential', 'buy', 'cartridge', 'careful', 'nt', 'spill']"

5.0,"I have the 7000 for a year or more now my nefew broke the trimer off while visiting trying to figure out how to open it. He is 14 I think. Anyway its useable but it's hard to hold on to due to the plastic wheel that turned the trimer. So with that said I bought the 9000 I have gotten it yet but I can't wait until I do. These razers are worth there price including the cleaning solution! I can't tell you how many electric razers I have went threw over the years, different name brands and have never ever found any that works as good as the 7000. So I can't wait to get the 9000 because I know it's going to be worth every penny. My 7000 blade still gives me a good shave after it being well over a year. Yes I do have a pretty good facial growth. For those who are bitching about the cleaner, first of all if you used your head you would know you don't need to clean it everytime you shave unless you are just that dirty. Next as of some others have said take it out and put the top back on until you are ready to use it again. I mean really you need someone to tell you that! Either way it goes it is much cheaper then using razers! I mean really look how much those cost that cut you every so often and takes just maybe three shaves before needing a new one. So from what I know and testing just what the different is in cost was the electric razer and the solution was cheaper than a raiser.

Sometimes I just don't want to touch water.

So, these refills do a decent job of the cleaning the razor for me.  Now, the razor seems to catch a good deal of the shaved whiskers, but many fall onto the sink or floor.  In any event, regardless of the actual congestion of the foil razor after shave, these cleaning cartridges do a fine job a rinsing them away.  Also, my razor unit indicates that an ""Eco"" clean is needed after one shave, so I only clean the razor every two shaves.  I love the lemon scent.

5.0,"This is a wonderful invention by Braun.  I love the blades, the shaver's head, and most of all, I like the fresh new razor feel every time I need to shave.  I know lots love the conventional blade from Gillette or Schick, but electric razors are so convenient and easy and fast, I just save minutes using the electric shaver.  Braun's clean and renew is awesome.  It's easy to install and it's easy to throw out.  The thing's got alcohol to clean and disinfect (for the face that is important) and lubricant which makes the blades strong longer.  I know it's about $10 per 2 to 2 and 1/2 months, but it is worth it.  As for the ""advice"" of do-it-yourself adding alcohol, if you're gonna do that, why buy this ""system"" in the first place?  Anyhow, I'm all for saving money and finding a good substitute for trivial expenses such as this, but you'll miss the ""lubricant"" ingredient and the other fine Braun contents.  Another poster mentioned that the ""lubricant"" remains and is always in the cartridge, but I guess it's not necessary to clean out the residues and what's inside the cartridge BEFORE filling with your homemade alcohol??  The Lubricant is just as important as the alcohol and without it, the blades will not be as sharp.  All in all, in you're gonna use the homemade way, why not just buy any generic electric shaver and just throw the blade and netting into a cup with the alcohol to save more money??  I just think Braun did us all a great service in being innovative and constantly improving its products.  My life is so much better from using Braun shavers and this Braun cleaner.

4.0,"I used to replace these cleaning cartridges once every 3 weeks and was spending a small fortune on them ... until I learned how to extend their usable life.
1. After shaving, pop off the screen and rinse it under running water. Without removing the cutter, rinse it, too. Replace the screen firmly and put the shaver into the cradle for cleaning right away. The alcohol in the fluid removes most of the tap water preventing corrosion of the shaver. By removing most of the debris, the fluid stays clean for 3 months.
2. The fluid in the cartridge slowly evaporates but the lubricant does not. When the indicator light on the cradle shows low fluid level, top the cartridge off with rubbing alcohol - 70% isopropyl - readily available at every pharmacy.

4.0,"The good news is that since these cleaning refill cartridges are made by the manufacturer, they are an exact fit, and they work just the way the original cartridge does.  However, there are a couple of things to think about:

Braun's manual says to run the cleaning cycle every day.  In reality, cleaning it every other day works just as well; I can't detect any difference between every-day and every-other-day cleaning.  As one reviewer notes, the cleaning liquid evaporates whether or not you run the cycle, but the simple fact is that the cartridge will run out sooner if you run the cleaning cycle every day.

You could just clean the Braun with the little cleaning brush.  But what's the point of buying a shaver with an automatic cleaning system, then not using it?

There are two bits of bad news.  First is the cost.  These things are very pricey; if you clean every day, and if a cartridge lasts about 30 cleanings, you'll spend about $60 per year.  That's just the way it goes.  You could easily pour the cheap or even home-brew cleaner of your choice into the empty cartridge, but that would be a VERY bad idea.  Whatever you put in won't have the lubricants that the factory liquid does, and that will cause your replaceable but expensive cutter head to wear out faster.  In addition, some cleaners would probably damage the machine.

Another bit of bad news is the mess.  You have to pry off two plastic lids then slide the brim-full cartridge into the cleaning base.  It is VERY difficult to do so without spilling some of the fluid.

Having said all of that, though, the fact is that if you want to use the Braun shaver to its full potential, you have to buy these cartridges.

5.0,"I've been using the Braun 7526 shaver and cleaning stand for 5+ years, and have found it to be the best balance of close shave with minimal irritation. I work in a chemistry lab so anytime I have a device that uses a ""solution"" I try to think how I can mimic it and save money and time. I make my own aftershave lotion by mixing rubbing alcohol + baby oil + water, mostly alcohol (17 parts), oil (3 parts), water (1 part), more oil if you want your skin to be softer, but it will shine. Shake well before each use. For the Braun cleaning solution, be aware that the red light comes on due to the level dropping low; it has nothing to do with the amount of hair debris in the solution. Dump the remaining solution; add water through the small hole and shake well to get as much of the hair debris out of the container. I use two ingredients in the solution: rubbing alcohol and finger nail polish remover (non-drying lemon scented). The volume of the solution is a little less than 6 ounces, but I make a mark on the side using a Sharpie when the container is new, and just fill to that level each time. Just add a couple ounces alcohol through the small hole (I got a small funnel at a hobby store), add a tablespoon (15 mL) of polish remover, slosh to mix, then add alcohol to the mark being sure the container is on a level surface. You can try to mix or let the shaver mix it when it recirculates. The polish remover is good at removing the oils left on the cutter/foil, and the non-drying formula leaves a trace of oily ingredient that seems to help lube the shaver as well.

4.0,"Well I've had my 8595 for over 3 weeks now and it looks like the solution is getting pretty dirty.  If you read my review on the 8595 you'll see I'm only cleaning it once a week and doing the reseal-the-cleaner-with-plug trick.

The solution is not evaporating as I expected, but even with all the wiskers trapped in the filter, the solution itself is getting darker.  I was hoping it would last longer, but it appears the only way to do that is to manually clean out the head before you drop it into the charger for auto-cleaning.

So I've given in, I just bought Qty 3 of this item... good enough for 6 months. As someone else commented earlier, you'll basically wind up spending $60 a year using one refill per month.  That boils down to $5/month.  You have to decide if $5/month is worth your time and effort to clean your shaver (even once a week) plus knowing that the cleaning solution has removed the oil and bacteria off the head and foil to minimize infection or in-grown wiskers.

Given the cost of gasoline and food nowadays, $5/month isn't too bad to me.  BUT the refills are not eco-friendly.  If Braun would get smart and sell a refill kit which came with a quart or two of solution and replacement filters, I'd buy that.  At least you could reuse the container over and over.  Just toss out the dirty filter and solution when it's time.

I read up on all the alcohol, lemon extract, silicon oil refill tricks, but they don't address the filter problem unless you backwash the container.  It was at that point I realized the time to rejuvenate the refill would equal the time I'd spend just to manually cleaning the head.

BTW, it looks like Amazon has fixed the shipping problem someone noted earlier.  Each of these items can be shipped for 50 cents.  So if you ship Qty 3, it's $1.50 for shipping, Qty 6 is $3.00, etc.  So my hats off to Amazon for reading the comments here and making the shipping reasonable.  I did my order on Amazon because it looks like on eBay, you only save about $2-$3 (depending on quantity) and some auctions claim their refills are old outdated stock.  Probably nothing wrong with that since they are sealed, but for $2, I'll just buy here to get the fresh stock.","Does the job, just not eco-friendly; Amazon improved shipping costs","['well', 'week', 'look', 'like', 'solution', 'get', 'pretty', 'dirty', 'read', 'review', 'see', 'clean', 'week', 'resealthecleanerwithplug', 'trick', 'solution', 'evaporate', 'expect', 'even', 'wisker', 'trap', 'filter', 'solution', 'get', 'darker', 'hope', 'would', 'last', 'long', 'appear', 'way', 'manually', 'clean', 'head', 'drop', 'charger', 'autocleane', 'give', 'buy', 'qty', 'item', 'good', 'enough', 'month', 'someone', 'else', 'comment', 'early', 'basically', 'wind', 'spending', 'year', 'use', 'one', 'refill', 'per', 'month', 'boils', 'month', 'decide', 'month', 'worth', 'time', 'effort', 'clean', 'shaver', 'even', 'week', 'plus', 'know', 'clean', 'solution', 'remove', 'oil', 'bacteria', 'head', 'foil', 'minimize', 'infection', 'ingrown', 'wisker', 'give', 'cost', 'gasoline', 'food', 'nowadays', 'month', 'nt', 'bad', 'refill', 'ecofriendly', 'braun', 'would', 'get', 'smart', 'sell', 'refill', 'kit', 'come', 'quart', 'two', 'solution', 'replacement', 'filter', 'buy', 'least', 'could', 'reuse', 'container', 'toss', 'dirty', 'filter', 'solution', 'time', 'read', 'alcohol', 'lemon', 'extract', 'silicon', 'oil', 'refill', 'trick', 'nt', 'address', 'filter', 'problem', 'unless', 'backwash', 'container', 'point', 'realize', 'time', 'rejuvenate', 'refill', 'would', 'equal', 'time', 'spend', 'manually', 'clean', 'head', 'btw', 'look', 'like', 'amazon', 'fix', 'shipping', 'problem', 'someone', 'note', 'early', 'item', 'ship', 'cent', 'ship', 'qty', 'shipping', 'qty', 'etc', 'hat', 'amazon', 'read', 'comment', 'make', 'shipping', 'reasonable', 'order', 'amazon', 'look', 'like', 'ebay', 'save', 'depend', 'quantity', 'auction', 'claim', 'refill', 'old', 'outdated', 'stock', 'probably', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'since', 'seal', 'buy', 'get', 'fresh', 'stock']"

5.0,"This is cleaning solution for the Braun 7000 series.

Since I only clean the shaver only two or three times a month, the solution that came with the shaver lasted one year.  You do not have to clean the shaver after every use as long as you take the head off and blow the stubble off...that is what I do.

4.0,"I have had my Syncro Shaver System for about a year now and love it.  Like all the rest these refills are a bit pricey.

4.0,"I typically use the cleaning solution twice a week; once on a Monday after a 'heavy shave' (I can't be bothered shaving at the weekend!) and once at the end of the week.  Anything more than that is unecessary, I find.

But when you do use it - oooh that next shave feels so good and smells fresh.  It's like using a new shaver.  So why don't I use it every day?  I don't think its worth the money - these things aren't cheap and, rather disappointingly, I'm not a millionaire, so having the 'new shaver' feel every day isn't justified.

And another tip: if you can be bothered, you can remove the solution after each use and re-plug it to avoid evaporation of the solution - which makes it last even longer.  But that's all a bit too much effort for me...!

So, Braun - stop charging so much for a simple alcohol solution and design the cleaner to automatically 'plug' the solution when its not in use to prevent evaporation, and you'll earn that last star!

This razor can be used without the ""clean and charge"" system but everyone seems to love that feature and wouldn't want to give it up.  I always shaved with a blade after trying a number of electric razors; however, after being placed on the drug Coumadin, I had to go to an electric razor.  I won't go back.  Five bucks a month for a cartridge beats at least 10 dollars a month in blades and it is much quicker and more effective.

4.0,"You don't HAVE to use the cleaning function of the Braun.  You can use it like any other shaver and clean it with a brush.  But if you don't mind paying ~$60/year on these refills, then the cleaning system works great.  I hope eventually someone decides to make generic versions of the refills or sells the fluid only so we can refill them (like they do with inkjet printer cartridges).  I would NOT take the advice of the guy who recommended using alcohol and lemon juice as a refilling liquid.  Lemon has sugar (and other impurities) in it, and alcohol doesn't have lubricating agents and may strip the lubricating that the blades need.

Cleaning every other day may seem like a money-saving idea, but I have found that even if you don't use it for weeks, the cleaning fluid still evaporates and you have to replace it almost as frequently, so I figure I might as well get the benefit of cleaning rather than let the stuff just evaporate away.

I hope Amazon starts selling these things directly since buying it from J&R is not a good deal because of the shipping charges.  Instead, go to Walgreens or some other store that sells the shaver system, and buy it there.  BestBuy.com sells it for the same price with free shipping.

4.0,"It looks like there's a lot of 5s and 1s for these reviews, and that's because both sides are right. The container is small for the price, and even more disappointing when you open it up. The texture of the putty is so dry that I assumed I had grabbed a really old one at first, and it's very hard to apply as it doesn't want to stick...particularly irksome when dealing with a top tooth like me, gravity is not your friend. It also sounds like they should take the ""replacing crowns"" off the label.

However, I was only trying to fill a hole, a small one on a back molar, and I had to change my opinion a few hours after application. After I finally wrestled with getting the putty to stay (I stuck with the instructions, flossing and brushing well but leaving my mouth moist) it dried relatively quickly. They say not to drink anything for an hour, which I turned into three: another poster had an excellent idea about doing it before you go to bed. While my cavity wasn't causing pain from pressure, it did from hot and cold food and liquid, and this fix made that disappear completely. By the next day I was feeling totally back to normal, and could even chew on that side again though I didn't want to chance it much. I also realized that despite being a tiny amount of putty that made me feel jipped at first, it went a long way for me and I've got about 4 more applications out of it. I imagine a full cap would use far far more of it than spackling a hole.

Today is day three, and I woke up with a lot of pain in that tooth. I actually came online now to look for solutions to remove the putty and reapply it (I wasn't sure if this was the cause, but I wasn't sure how else to be proactive about it when a dentist is too expensive.) From what I've been able to find, it gradually wears away and sometimes the whole chunk comes loose if the contact is loosened enough. I was worried the new pain was the putty somehow expanding, but it doesn't sound like that's the case and the pain's mostly vanished for the time being, so it's probably from the cavity.

I just wanted to say that I just read through all the reviews, and I really think both sides are right on the money. As a short lived fix, I think it's a very cheap way to get a few extra days to weeks to save up for a dentist (while looking for that new job and medical.)

1.0,"I'm 55, raised as the daughter of a dentist. I've worked in his office, been trained in the most basic dental work and used my fair share of ""temp"" dental fix products. DON'T buy DENTEMP. I recently chipped a cusp off of a tooth and bought this at my local grocery store. I got it home and the putty is dry, worthless and crumbling. I thought maybe it was just old, but the next three were the same way - brittle, crumbling etc. Adding moisture to the putty made it worse. Handling it made it worse. Even the most minimal action of making a ball (per directions) to apply this to the tooth made the product drier.

Digging down to the bottom of the miniscule little container I found some putty that was almost moist and was able to fashion a bit of a repair. It lasted less than one minute. I got a second container. It was drier than the first. I went back out and got the product from two other stores in case I happened upon a bad case at the one store. Nope. All the same.

I now have a second piece on the tooth and am hoping it *takes* and stays on long enough to create a barrier to protect the tooth. I tried both the thin and thick application (it doesn't take much and it's not supposed to - three paper sheets thickness is all you need. Enamel is not supposed to be a 1/4"" thick!) and had no luck with either.

The hassle of contacting the company may/may not be worth it if FOUR caps of the product from (1) Walmart, (2) Two from Food Lion and (3) CVS were all equally dry and inadequate. The concept is good and with the right product you can protect your tooth until you can get to a dentist.

5.0,"I suffered from some enamel loss on my front teeth and had bonding placed on the back surface years ago. The bonding recently fell out which exposed a thin front tooth & cavity. As I was not able to make it to the dentist any time soon, I looked around for a temporary solution and found Dentemp OS.

I placed some of the Dentemp OS on the back of the tooth which hardened and lasted for 2-3 weeks. I found the product to be very strong and only wore away very gradually over time. This product was literally non-removable once it had hardened and only eventually fell out when I sneezed.

At which time I reapplied the product and it lasted for another 2-3 weeks before falling out again when sneezing. I've now repeated another application which I fully expect will last another 2-3 weeks. This product works so well I haven't been in a rush to get to the dentist but I do plan to go eventually.

This product may not work for everyone depending on what the issue with your teeth is, and I can see how some others would say that it's a waste of money which may be due to whatever their dental problem is or they may not have installed the product properly even though they thought they were following the instructions.

5.0,"I lost a filling just before the weekend and knew I would have to wait till the following Monday to call the dentist. Saturday morning I woke up in a lot of pain. I was taking 800 mg of Ibuprofen and 1500 mg of Tylenol every 8 hours and 4 hours, respectively. At first it kept things under control... until I tried to eat and drink. It didn't matter how careful I was, once the pain started there was no going back. My whole jaw on that side, my cheekbone, my ear...it was too much. I called the number for the 24 hr nurse on my health card for any advice. The upshot was that I should try the dentemp (and get a script from my primary in case of infection). My husband picked up the dentemp and I went on-line to read the reviews. I was quite disheartened and if I had seen these beforehand I probably wouldn't have used it.
When I got the dentemp I made a small ball of it between my fingers (think silly putty) and stuck it in the hole, pressed and then bit down. Within two minutes the pain was GONE! I could feel where it had hurt and was grateful. In a little while I couldn't even feel that little remnant of pain. Thre was no numbness in any of the surrounding areas, the pain simply did not exist!
I was able to eat and drink all the things I normally eat and drink over the rest of the weekend, albeit, carefully.

Relating to a previous reviewer, the product I got had the polymer as the last ingredient.

One problem with this product is that the material is very thick, which might make it useful for filling holes, but makes it nearly useless as a cement, since it is impossible to spread in a layer thin enough to result in a comfortable fit.  In addition, it does not seem to like to adhere to the crown material.  Nor to the tooth for that matter.

1.0,"The reason you see such variation in reviews for this product is because they
have changed their formulation.  I bought some about 18 months ago and it
worked exceedingly well.  Recently I again had need for it.
I had a tiny bit of Dentemp OS left that was still pliable so I used it
and it lasted about 8 days which wasn't bad for 18 month old product.
(When fresh it used to last about 2 weeks, just enough time to be able to
set up a dental appt at a time both you and the dentist could manage.)

The NEW product however, is NOT the same as the older product.
The formulation has CHANGED! The pkg had the ingredients in a
completely different order and the consistency and staying power
are astronomically reduced.  Now it lasts about 12 hours per repair.
(That's after putting it on just before bedtime and letting it set
for 8 hours before eating anything.)

This new formulation is as HORRIBLE as the former product was GOOD,
even though the name hasn't changed, nor is there any indication that
there has been a change.  If I hadn't kept the old pkg, I wouldn't know
WHY this stuff no longer works, but having the two ingredient lists side by side,
clearly shows that the polymer, which was the 1st ingredient is now among the last.
This is the binding agent.
Sadly, what was once a great product is no longer worth your money at all.

I'd attempted to contact the company and (not so) surprisingly, the web address
on the pkg is no longer operational. The email address for dentemp os customer service
found online at their parent company is no longer valid either. This can only lead me
to one conclusion.  They realize they had a great product and decided to use the name
and reputation they'd built to now sell their new inferior formulation while making
sure they were not reachable for those who would take the time to register dissatsifying
experiences.

Yet again, a company has cheapened the product to the point of making it useless,
while living off the good name they HAD been known for- AND while disabling their
customer service so you are completely ""had"" by a legal con game.  This seems to be
the new American fraud that so many companies perpetrate against their formerly
loyal clientelle.  No wonder America is failing economically and the American name
no longer represents quality.

Save your money, buy the cheap store brands, they are no better, but no worse either
and are generally less costly and more easily available....
or better yet, unless you can reapply this stuff 3 times or more daily, beg your dentist
for an emergency appointment, then hope you aren't charged extra for having to be squeezed in
or for having your doc put in some extra hours for your emergency.

Guess I feel a bit ticked off after thinking the new product would be as good as the old
and thereby making my dental appt. for 2 weeks- when the doc and my own schedule aligned.
Now, after getting this, I realize I'll be buying 1 of these (or some generic brand) per
day until the timeof my appointment unless (hopefully) my dentist gets a cancellation.

When they have a good product, why do they have to cheapen it and RUIN it?

Look over the various reports on this here on Amazon. (There are different packaging options
of the same product.  Some carry the old formulation on the listing, some not, but whether
or not you'll actually GET the older product is anyone's guess)  Now you know why you see

The best measurement is the 8+ repairs but that's easy to miss. You've fufilled your legal obligation but not your moral one.

Do you really lay awake wondering which one is the best? I guess I should be grateful that you're using it, but please. Let me just give you a piece of advice...chicks hate bad breath, but there's such a thing as ""overdoing it"". Any brand works reasonably well, trust me.

OK, since you are actually looking for a complete stranger's opinion on MOUTHWASH, I'll do you a favor and tell you how it works. First you take this 50 oz. bottle of Scope (and yes, if you must know, Scope is the best tasting at least). Drink down at least half of it. I know it's a little painful to chug but get it down fast. Then go somewhere where you have a lot of room and twist as hard and as much as you can so that the Scope gets all around your gastrointestinal system. See, that's where bad breath starts. You nip it in the bud that way. I know you'll only get two uses out of this bottle but your breath will smell great.

I tried every cream, gel and moisturizing scrub I could find. I saw an online post from a dermatologist, who said the symptoms likely meant psoriasis, and to try Carmol 20. I did, massaging the cream into my elbows twice per day.  I can't believe the difference one week made.  On the first day, my elbows first felt noticeably softer to the touch.  On the  second day, they were ""peeling"" -- much like the soft peels that follow a sunburn. On the third day the dead skin was actively falling away each time I buffed with a washcloth.  By the fifth day, all the dead skin had flaked away in the sink, and the skin was soft, new, and tender - like baby skin.  I'm now applying the Carmol 20 two times a day, and I actually get teary eyed.  It's the first time in a decade that my elbows look, and feel, completely  normal.

I find myself shaving with Williams Mug Shaving Soap (same company) and this 9 Times out of 10 because they feel and smell like shaving products should. Masculine and old school.

I like the menthol tingle and lasting but understated talc and leather scent. It dries down MUCH better than it smells out of the bottle.

It's crisp, clean, has a masculine menthol smell, and will leave your skin soft, without any residue. Truly, it's likely the aftershave that your grandfather used. Sure, it burns initially, but that's how you know that your post-shave skin is being sealed from bacteria and infection.

There's also something more personally nostalgic about it for me: this was one of the first aftershaves that I used in high school, some 20 years ago. Since this product hasn't changed much (OK, the bottles aren't glass anymore, sadly), just the smell of it takes me back to a simpler time, old friends that I don't see anymore, and a special girl in Montreal.

If you are familiar how ""Imitation"" Perfumes and Colognes smell - they never smell like the REAL stuff. That's what makes me believe it is probably a knock-off from China - or somewhere else.

I had just got done taking a shower and then shaved. I opened the bottle for the first time and splashed some on my face and neck and was immediately shocked by the STENCH!! I washed my face off with soap and water a few times to get rid of the smell. Plus - it didn't tingle/burn like putting on REAL Aqua Velva right after shaving with a blade razor.

Beware of ordering this from Amazon. You are better off buying it at your local Walmart or wherever.

For me it was not worth sending back as it was an add-on item and only a few bucks. Still - I was rather disappointed. I ended up going to my local Shopko and getting the Aqua Velva there.

5.0,"My go-to aftershave is Nivea for Men Sensitive Post Shave Balm. It's a wonderfully soothing aftershave with zero burn.  But every now and then, I like to use a nice classic aftershave.  I grew up using Brut,  because that's what dad used.  I've also used Old Spice (burn!),  Pinaud Bay Rum (BURNNNNN!!!! BUUURRRRRRRNNNN!  Ahhhh!  Death by Aftershave!)  and my sentimental favorite: Skin Bracer.  My grandfather wore Skin Bracer.  He has now long since passed, but just a wiff of Skin Bracer puts me right back in his wood shop.  One of the features I love about Skin Bracer is the menthol, and knowing that Aqua Velva was a cooling aftershave as well, I thought I would pick up a bottle today and try it.
I'm impressed.
If you're familiar with Skin Bracer, you know that what you get (besides many happy memories) is a fairly intense burn followed by a wonderful cooling sensation.

(Not talking about the sting of alcohol here; products that contain musk and other scents start to itch after they've been on a while.)  Aqua Velva doesn't; just does it's job of cauterizing the nerves exposed by shaving, and then goes away.

I like this product better than bay rum (I just bought a
gallon). I like the fragrance, which goes on strong -
but dissipates into a low-key scent that's just right.
It cools and refreshes my face after shaving and leaves
me with a tingly feeling that's welcome in the morning.

My father used this stuff in the sixties, and it's funny
how scents take me back in time. The scent reminds
me of my Dad, and how dearly I miss him.

with things made and used decades ago. Don't get me started
on cars from the sixties and early seventies.

2.0,"This is a very inexpensive aftershave, and it smells great imo. The only problem for me is the menthol. Alcohol based aftershave does not bother me at all, but the menthol does. Not only does it sting excessively when I first apply the aftershave, it leave my skin slightly irritated for hours afterwards. This is an issue for me even when I apply the Aqua Velva to areas I haven't actually shaved (like say the back of my neck). Due to its low price and very pleasant scent WOULD actually recommend this to anyone who likes an aftershave that contains menthol or who is curious to try one.

5.0,"Many years ago, I used ""Aqua Velva"" as just an ordinary aftershave lotion. This was when men just used an aftershave to cool the scrathes that occurred when using those old ""safety razors"". It was either Aqua Velva or Old Spice. The choices were very limited and guys just didn't care anyway. Then came this revelation of men's scented products which women seemed to like and a new industry was born. A couple of years ago I was in a CVS, Rite Aide or wherever when I saw this little plastic bottle called ""Ice Sport"". I said to myself that this is just another rip off name for Aqua Velva, which to me is much to strong in its destinctive scent and sort of ""dates"" a guy. I tried the Ice Sport and it was an awakening. It is this refreshing after shave feeling I look foward to in the AM before work. Then suddenly in the last year, this product disappeared from shelves everywhere. When I Googled the product a few days ago (7/27/2011), I found that Amazon.com still had some in stock. I ordered enough of the 3.5 oz plastic bottles to last many, many years.

5.0,"HEY!! I am an Aqua Velva Man and absolutely love this stuff, been using it for over 50 years. This is a true after shave lotion classic. Not quite sure how many women that have been attracted to me because of Aqua Velva,  I do know for sure that it's just to many to count. Ha.  Not sure how long this has been around but the Williams Company ran a paper advertisement, taken from a 1949 magazine, which features Ralph Bellamy of Detective Story and Ezio Pinza of South Pacific for Aqua Velva After Shave Lotion. I'm sure you all remember Ralph Bellamy and Ezio Pinza from the 40's right.

There slogan was "" There is nothing like an AQUA VELVA MAN "" and it seemed to work because this was a hot item when I was a young man. It's just amazing that this is still around when the vast majority of after shave lotions from that time period have disappeared over the years.

The only negative about Aqua Velva is it does not last very long. Usually in less than an hour the aroma has dissipated. The more expensive after shave lotions and perfumes have Ambergris in them which is quite expensive and comes from a sperm whale this enables the aroma to linger much longer.

My favorite after shave.

By the way -- my present supply is in a plastic container labeled, ""New Shatterproof Bottle!"".  #1. I really don't think the marketers care if it's shatterproof or not.  They want to improve profit margin.  The plastic is ok, but if there was a choice . . . I'd take glass.  #2  Whoever designed and then signed off on this horrid bottle should be fired. I suspect in the interest of getting the consumer to use more, the hole in the top of the bottle is too big.

As another reviewer noted, the trimmer does not come with the bag shown in the picture, which means that you get to figure out a way to keep the trimmer and the brush together.  For this reason and because I would have liked the trimmer to cut just a tiny bit closer, I give it 4 stars instead of 5.

All those camping trips where day 3 rolled around and I was starting to think I might get mistaken for Sasquatch...Never again.
With the guard set on the lowest setting, it is totally safe to use on underarms. With the guard off, I have no problem using it on my legs. Sure it's not a super close shave like a razor, but I'M IN THE WOODS. WEARING LONG SLEEVES AND BUG SPRAY. No one is all up in my pits like, hmmmm you missed a spot. The sexy factor isn't as important as feeling clean! And anyway, have you ever tried shaving with a razor in the morning and heading to a saltwater beach with fresh razorburn? Yow.
To keep it clean, take off the guard after use and wipe down the head with an alcohol wipe. The guard rinses clean easily.

It took me about 6 months to grow out and I soon realized it was completely out of control, beyond the point where a regular razor or wax could fix it. I first used scissors to try to trim it up but that was fairly useless as it was difficult to achieve a somewhat uniform length of hair. After reading the reviews of this trimmer, I decided to give it a try. On my first try, I was able to trim the hair to a perfect length to keep those stretch marks hidden, and I was able to get some of the areas short enough to be able to wax some of the hair off. I look so much neater and feel much more confident now.

The sound reverberated through the floor. It was actually hilarious. We removed the toilet from the floor, pulled the trimmer out, and bolted the toilet back down.

Now, I didn't use it again after that but the fact that the power continued working (and the trimmer motor was still super strong) sealed the deal that this is the only trimmer I will ever buy.

1.0,"So it stopped working after 7-8 months.  I looked up the warranty document and it said 2 years warranty for shavers and directed to a Panasonic website address. The website requires you to register to file online requests for service.  When you register and fill the service request it says online request is unavailable for this product,  contact local service providers.  When you look up the list,  you get a physical address in Texas with no phone number or email. There is also an online support chat that appears to be unmanned at all times.  Bottomline,  the Panasonic warranty is a hoax - non-existent.
I opened up the shaver to look inside to see if it was something easily fixed. It is fairly easy to open. I found that water had leaked into the unit and the motor was rusted in parts.  Nothing else was amiss.  Cleaning up the rust did not revive the unit. I had always used it dry and the only water contact was for gingerly washing the blade end of the shaver with soap and water while keeping rest of the unit dry. Surely the manufacturer doesn't expect a bikini shaver to be used without washing or cleaning at any point!
Save your money and buy the ES2207p. It is a bit more expensive and bulky but works till the blades become blunt.

And that's my only issue with this product: The guard and the blade seem cheaply made and I do anticipate they will break and I will need to replace them. When I pull off the guard or remove the blade to clean the inside, I feel like I have to pull so hard on cheap plastic that I'll crack it.

It fits in my hand very well, and smoothly glides across my skin in a silent and comfortable manner. It also comes with an adjustable comb piece, so you can decided if you only want to "" take a little off the top."" I myself just take the whole thing off altogether and trim as far down as I can.

I use the product without a safety head for a closer trim, and while not advised, it does work fine. However if you are going to use it like this make sure the batteries are at a full charge, there are minor catching issues if it's not at full power. But that's completely my fault, of course.

It would be nice to have some sort of indication that the batteries are running low because it sounds like it is working at full power, but it's a bit less effective when you need a battery change.

5.0,"Purchased this product several years ago for bikini area trimming and shaping (and as a substitute for shaving) after finally becoming too fed-up with the irritation and annoyance of shaving. This trimmer is slender enough to easily maneuver, and I find that its use without the removable guard provides sufficient hair removal to replace shaving, for me. Don't expect a baby-smooth finish, since this product will not yield a ""close-shave,"" but I much prefer this experience to the itching and in-grown hairs and irritation and hassle I experienced for years with shaving. Has stood up incredibly well to occasional use over the course of nearly 4 years; still runs on the batteries first installed. The removable/adjustable guard (I believe it has four different settings to allow for a longer trim to a very short trim) is very helpful for personalizing your trim and makes cleaning the blades much easier, made easier still by a handy little brush. Comes in a convenient suede-style, pull-string baggie for storage/travel. A reliable and convenient addition to your personal grooming routine, whether to replace shaving or to supplement shaving with shaping/trimming. I will continue to use for years to come.

I always use it on the shortest setting with the gaurd on, and I have never nicked myself. I have tried it without the gaurd, which gets a much closer shave (not razor close, but shorter) but I found that the stuble left over was too prickly for my taste and I prefer the short but flat laying length from useing the gaurd.

TIPS: Only use it on dry hair, or else the head gets cloged with the trimmed hairs. I like to use it right before I get in the shower. Also, using it on dry hairs lets you easly remove the gaurd and brush off the head so you don't have to get it wet to clean it.

4.0,"I've had this trimmer for a few years now and it works great. It comes with an adjustable plastic ""cap"" (for lack of a better word!) that adjusts to 5 different lengths and lets you choose how long or short you'd like to cut the hair.

Perhaps because it is an older model I have been unable to find replacement blades! So be sure to take good care of the one it comes with.

This item is advertised as a trimmer.  Not a shaver.  When people complain that when they take the guard off and it cuts them, guess what: it's not designed to be used without the guard on.  Second, it's advertised as a women's implement.  It doesn't care if it's a man or a woman's hair it's trimming, it will cut it just the same.  In fact, it doesn't even care if it's a human.  I cleaned up my dog's summer fur trim with this thing perfectly fine.  It's a great little multi purpose tool, if you understand what it's designed for.  It uses AA batteries, and it feels solid and sturdy.  It's a compact little hair trimmer, and I can't recommend it enough.

5.0,"This trimmer is fantastic. It works very well. I used to use scissors to trim my downstairs area, and talk about OUCH. I cut myself too many times to continue with that form of grooming. I also do not shave completely bare because I cannot stand the re-growing process. Enter the bikini shaper and trimmer! It has changed my grooming habits!

I use this trimmer without the trimming guide (I remove the head completely), and I haven't had one cut from not using it. This does not leave a completely hairless shave, but I already knew that prior to my purchase. Using it without the trimming guide leaves minuscule hair and feels great. If you use the trimming guide, you will still have quite some hair left, especially depending on the setting (setting ranges from 1-5 for length of hair). I use it toward the grain, against the grain, and all over down there, and I have not had any problems with re-growth or itching. I would highly recommend this product for individuals looking for a great downstairs trimmer.

Not only is it great for women, but my husband uses it, too! He highly recommends it for males who do not want to go completely hairless but want to tidy things up down there.

5.0,"I just got this item, but after going through numerous trimmers over the years I feel like this one warrants the hasty 5 star review. When I opened the rather unimpressive packaging I was surprised to find a very well made, sturdy feeling trimmer. The plastic is smooth, the guard feels nice and strong, not cheaply made. The guard itself stays in place well when you move it to different settings. The blade comes off very easily for you to clean it, and again feels well made. It also includes one of those cheap little brushes to help you clean the blade after use. I also noticed that the trimmer I received was made in Japan, not China like most items you get these days.

I like that this trimmer is much smaller in profile than other trimmers I have used in the past. It was easy to navigate in tight places and I never once felt worried that I would snag, tug, or cut myself with this trimmer while I was using it, like I have with trimmers I have used in the past.

5.0,"This item is honestly so amazing. It was better then I expected it would be. It's appearance is super pleasant, being a nice smooth simple shape that doesn't right away resemble a shaver.. And it feels super sturdy: it's weight is nice and the object in general is strong and compact. When I tried it out I explored each layer setting cautiously, because I've never used a shaver and I have this fear of getting cuts in that area. When I finally made it to the first and shortest setting, it worked absolutely perfect- with no accidents!!! I was able to trim my entire surface; I do it sitting on the toilet because my tub drain has clogging issues. I later checked in the mirror and I was able to reach every area fine because it's so easy to maneuver :) and I gotta say, the results make me feel a million tines more confident!!!

The blades are removable for cleaning, as well as replacing.
It runs on AA batteries, which aren't included. I was afraid I didn't have any, but managed to find some stashed at the back of our kitchen ""junk drawer"" to try it out with.
The blade cover moves up and down when you press the tabs on the side and push/pull. There are 5 easily listed levels. 5 is the level to get the longest hair, and 1 is the shortest. It was so simple. No pulling, no nervousness. I'm so happy to have this thing!!

5.0,"Was exactly what I wanted. And at a great price too! I was looking to get something to give a pretty close trim without actually shaving and this does a perfect job! It leaves a few mm of hair which is great if you don't want ingrown hairs. It comes with a attachable guide but I never use it. This day in age nude is in lol. But it's nice that it's one adjustable thing rather than a whole bunch of peices. I also like that it's cordless and requires batteries. Just because i saw on other products I looked at that the rechargeable battery it came with died in a year or so. Also I liked that you have the option to order a new trimmer head if needed. This trimmer isn't the prettiest or ergonomic thing in the world but it's gets the job done. And it's not like you have to impress anyone while trimming your pubes since you're alone lol. Also this is a dry trimmer only!! Which was totally fine by me because I only trim when it's dry. Easiest way I found is sit on a toilet and lean slightly over and trim WITH the hair. It will snag if you go against the hair and that's not fun. Also if you're wanting to trim in the ""delacate"" areas take your time and be very careful. I did cut myself a few times but it was my fault not the trimmer. It really wasn't all that painful just a little pinch and a trickle of blood. Certainly not even close to as painful as razor burn and I healed very quickly from it. Isn't as bad as people are acting like it to be. I just ended up using a regular razor for that area. I saw a lot of reviews complaining about that but what do you expect? Your putting something meant for cutting coarse hair on the most delacate area on the body and the loosest thinnest skin... It's kind of common sense people. If you really really want to use it for that area make sure to pull the skin taught and use baby powder so it can glide easily. Overall I'm very happy with this purchase and I love the quality and simplicity of it. And it Doesn't take a lot of space in my drawer which is a huge plus! I also loved that it didn't come with a bunch of gimmicky things that I wouldn't use.

5.0,"I hate, hate, hate shaving my lady bits! I stopped a decade ago because my skin is just too sensitive and really, who wants ingrown hairs or pimples on their nether regions? And don't even get me started on getting sharp razor blades down there. I was a devout waxer for many a year before I lost my job and had to use my money on other less-frivolous purchases... like food. I saved so much money from not waxing, that when I did have the cash to go again, I had a hard time doing it.

But alas, I digress. This purple little blessing has saved my crotch from any more abuse! It is super easy to use, clean, and adjust. The guard makes it so much easier to use, since I'm not sweating bullets that I'm about to lose an important part of my anatomy. I finally can have the gorgeous hoo-ha I've always wanted, without all the pain! I love a close trim because it doesn't make me feel like a little girl the way waxing did. I can still be a clean, sexy woman without worrying about how much of my bush is hanging out the sides of my bikini. On that note... with the guard on it doesn't get those little wispy buggers that hang out on the outside of the bikini area, so I use the trimmer without the guard VERY CAREFULLY so as not to nick myself. Do not try this until you get the hang of the trimmer, or you and your girl will regret it.

It requires batteries which is nice because you can take it anywhere without a plug yanking you back. Trim length is adjustable. The short setting is perfectly safe with the guard of course. It comes with a little brush to keep the guard and blades free of hair.

Initial review: I've used a few different trimmers over the years, and this is my favorite. I've been using this for three months now. Please note this is a *trimmer*, not a shaver. Although I suppose you could take the guard off, I wouldn't recommend using this for a full shave. My previous trimmer was rechargeable, but I actually prefer batteries. The charge would frequently last no longer than a few minutes, even when I actually remembered to charge it. My favorite feature of this trimmer is that the pointed tips of the guards are rounded.

No need to excessively worry about all your female bits getting in there either, just take care to move them out of the way.  I went in all directions with it, in order to get an even trim.  First against the hair growth, then from the inside toward the out.  Another concern for me was the length it would leave the hair, so let me tell you.  It's got this great little number system by the way, on the front of the guide, it's 1 - 5.  I cut mine at 2, I may go to a three next time.

  #2 is 1/4"" length

For me, the trimmer blade kept nicking my skin (which is not what you want when you're grooming the delicate areas), and using the guide takes forever to shorten longer hairs to a better length.

2.0,"UPDATE:

My shaver worked well until it stopped completely after a year.  It would not charge so I could not use the product.  I've just spoken to the warranty service reps and will send it in.  That will cost me shipping and the hassle, of course.  Good thing there's a 2 year warranty.  Will update after I hear back.

Pros:
-Excellent price on Amazon
-Made in Japan (not China!)
-Trimmer works well on long to medium hairs
-Shaper provides a close almost-shave
-Designed to reach all contours of the body
-Battery operation MUCH more convenient than plug-in

I personally was hoping it'd mimic the results of shaving, so I took off the guard head and used it that way and surprisingly - I had no cuts or snagging, and it cut everything so short that it isn't noticeable, but the follicles are still minutely above skin so I don't have to deal with the pain and razor burns when it starts to grow back.

I'm honestly so happy to have a relief of trimming my bikini line come summer.
I highly recommend the Panasonic trimmer.","Same visual results as shaving, but 100x better and easier!!","['exactly', 'look', 'first', 'trimmer', 'ever', 'use', 'ca', 'nt', 'believe', 'use', 'normal', 'razor', 'time', 'work', 'fantastically', 'guard', 'head', 'trim', 'easily', 'without', 'snag', 'love', 'adjust', 'length', 'personally', 'hope', 'mimic', 'result', 'shaving', 'take', 'guard', 'head', 'use', 'way', 'surprisingly', 'cut', 'snag', 'cut', 'everything', 'short', 'nt', 'noticeable', 'follicle', 'still', 'minutely', 'skin', 'nt', 'deal', 'pain', 'razor', 'burns', 'start', 'grow', 'back', 'honestly', 'happy', 'relief', 'trim', 'bikini', 'line', 'come', 'summer', 'highly', 'mend', 'panasonic', 'trimmer']"

I had been using a very similarly-shaped device, but smaller, and cheaper, and I hadn't used the guard on that either--I can see why it'd be useful to trip a beard a certain length, etc., but for bikini-line trimming, using the guard just doesn't make sense to me. Pull skin taught so that you'll be less likely to nick yourself. I did a couple of times, but it didn't even really feel like a nick, more like just the sharp point dug in a bit.

4.0,"This works pretty good for a battery-operated trimmer. It has just as much as power as my husbands corded, electric razor. Though it is small enough to get to all the lady parts, unlike a regular sized trimmer, which is great.

The trimmer lasts a fair amount of time before needing the batteries to be replaced. I was able to get everything trimmed fairly easily. Its size makes maneuvering it in small places, like the bikini area, fairly easy. It also has an optional cap that goes over the blades, preventing it from causing cuts and nicks. I tend not to use this cap however, because it doesnt allow for as close of a shave.

The one drawback is that the blades got dull pretty quick, and it sometimes snags a hair, and cuts the skin which can be quite painful. Obviously, placing the cap over it would help with this, but like I said earlier, then you don't get as close of a shave.

Overall, it works pretty well, and I use it fairly regularly. I have yet to find a perfect trimmer though, especially for the bikini area that shaves closer without occasional nicks or cuts.

I never find trimmers that slim, it's really nice to not have to worry about nicking anything. And the guard is on the head very securely so I don't worry about any slips. Works great, may buy a second one for my guy so he can clean up if he wants, it has different settings on the guard that are all useful and I think a male would appreciate.

It's obviously a quality product if it's been around so long and hasn't changed any. I think that the 11 years of use I got out of it was acceptable (and it cost $10 more back when I got it) so I don't mind having to buy it again now.

The trimmer adjusts to various lengths and I've only ever had it ""snag"" if I wasn't using the guard and was trying to get a close shave. Even then it didn't happen often, and I have very coarse hair. I'm somewhat disappointed that after all these years they didn't make a rechargeable version of it, but I can't hold that against this model. The battery life is decent.

Now that I'm used to something buzzing between my legs, I'm quite comfortable with it.

I'm really quite pleased with how close the trimmer gets; I actually feel smooth in some places (where hair is slightly less coarse), and everywhere else is neat and evenly trim.  As many others have noted, this is *not* going to give you the amazingly soft, post-professional wax feel.  But it does trim well, and if you're not living in a bathing suit this summer, it covers your (or at least my) bases for everyday grooming.

Hair tends to fly upward, so I find it cleanest to use this in the shower *with the water off,* with a hand mirror available, and without a top on.  (I've tried it mostly dressed and sitting on the toilet - which I wouldn't recommend unless you're into picking fuzz out of cotton.)

Pros:
Good for grooming male or female private areas
Can close your eyes and trim without worrying about nicks
No need to worry about batteries running out or not retaining charge
Easy to handle and maneuver in hard to reach areas
Low maintenance, no oiling of blade
Cordless

Cons:
Not very powerful (need to go over same area multiple times)

Need more run-time:
Battery door build seems a bit flimsy (time will tell)

Two, I like to shave my bikini area more like a Brazilian type shave than just a bikini line. How does it do on those really sensitive areas?

5.0,"This Panasonic is so much better than my old trimmer, a Remington rechargable. The speed of the blade is much faster and trims with fewer passes as compared to my old remington. This trimmer has many different length settings, which is also appreciated, and the attachment that adjusts for length very sturdy (not so with my old remington, where I broke one of the attachments fairly easily after about 2 years of use). The other pro is that the trimmer comes with a guide for the different parts in case you need to re-order a part. My old remington did not come with that, and so after I broke one of the attachments I had to use an attachment with longer lengths only.

The trimmer is battery operated, which I really like. I used to have to charge the remington ahead of time, before each time as the battery did not hold power very well. Because of earlier reviews that the panasonic drains the battery, I just take the batteries out between uses.

5.0,"When i first started using this trimmer i was really surprised at how quickly it was getting the hair off, zip, zip...and i have pretty long curly hair in that area.  Then i was somewhat disappointed that it didn't really trim very low, not to stubble length so i could use another shaver for fine tuning. It left the hair about 1/2 inch in length and i was a bit ho hum about it because i thought it would get it lower.  But i decided 1/2 inch was fine and i actually liked how it looked -- sooooo much neater -- and i was happy with it then.  I was using it at level 1.  After looking at myself forever it suddenly occurred to me that maybe i should remove the comb thing and just use it with the blade.  Wow...was i surprised! It took me down to real stubble, probably less than 1/8 of an inch!  I was really happy with that and was able to see then what a good little trimmer this really was. I was then able to use another shaver for a clean look for a quick vacation at the beach.  I must say though that I do like the 1/4 inch length and will probably keep that for my everyday look, but am really happy to have the option to go really low when i need to.

I discovered that by taking off the plastic guard, and being VERY careful, I got a trim almost as close as a shave.

4.0,"I bought this razor a few months ago because I wanted the bare look, but my skin is very sensitive and shaving just wasn't cutting it. Waxing was too expensive/painful/embarrassing/messy of an option for me and epilators seemed intimidating as well.

This is a great, economical option for me. I use it without the guard and get the hair down to just a stubble (I've never cut myself). That avoids any skin irritation (itching or bumps) but still keeps things neat. I'd give it five stars if it could make it completely smooth, but that probably brings back irritation issues.

I also have no problem using a razor and cream to shave around my lips - it's only the mons that get irritated, so you might try that to get the smoothest results where it counts most :-)

I've also used it, with the guard, to trim the longer hairs around my boyfriend's nipples.

5.0,"Well, I can honestly say after doing MUCH research within the ""bikini hair-removing"" area, this was the best thing I could have ever bought. I looked up bikini trimmers, the shavers, the wax, and this product definitely beats them all. I actually used to use the Shick Intuition Razer and, even with shaving cream, I always itched afterwards and got shave bumps and, it was quite annoying. Then I began researching, bought this product, and I have not been disappointed. I guess depending on what you like, the little part that goes on the top lets you adjust how long you want your hair, the settings go from 1-5. I personally like it very very short, so I just take the additional part on top off and use the trimmer by itself. I found this works well. I have had this for 2 months I think and I'm still on the first set of batteries, and I usually use it for about 5 minutes or so each time I trim, once a week, so, the battery life is pretty good.

This has a bikini trimmer attachment that can trim the hair down south.

If you want just a bikini trimmer, or you like to be able to shape the hair more exactly, this is a good choice.  However, if you just need to trim down, and also epilate, the Braun product does a decent job of just trimming it down---the price of it is a little over double of the trimmer, but therefore works well as a combination product for a couple different needs.","Works well, seems a bit pricey","['bikini', 'trimmer', 'work', 'well', 'issue', 'also', 'epilate', 'may', 'well', 'save', 'money', 'buy', 'braun', 'silkpil', 'xelle', 'body', 'system', 'epilator', 'nbsp', 'datahook', 'productlinklinke', 'class', 'alinknormal', 'href', 'braunsilkpilxellebodysystemepilatordpbezyktsrefcmcrarpdrvwtxt', 'ieutf', 'braun', 'silkpil', 'xelle', 'body', 'system', 'epilator', 'bikini', 'trimmer', 'attachment', 'trim', 'hair', 'south', 'want', 'bikini', 'trimmer', 'like', 'able', 'shape', 'hair', 'exactly', 'good', 'choice', 'however', 'need', 'trim', 'also', 'epilate', 'braun', 'product', 'decent', 'job', 'trim', 'price', 'little', 'double', 'trimmer', 'therefore', 'work', 'well', 'combination', 'product', 'couple', 'different', 'need']"

Honestly I had low expectations when I ordered the product, but with all the great reviews this Panasonic trimmer has received I figured what the heck I'll give a shot. And all I can say is WOW! WHY did I not have this trimmer before now? The Panasonic ES246 AC allows you to adjust the the length of the cut to five different settings which allows you to get as close (or not) as you'd like. You can remove the guard and trim without it, but you have to be careful and go slowly or you'll nick yourself. I trimmed without the guard on and I got a pretty close shave that way. Was it perfectly smooth? No, but it was a cinch to use a quality razor to finish off that part. Also, I should note that as someone who has sensitive skin, I was able to get a pretty darn close shave without any razor burn, rashes, or ingrown hairs.

5.0,"To begin with: For irrational reason like the name ""Panasonic"" I did not like the company.
Over the years, in search for perfect shaving, ~$4000 spent in experimenting; only Panasonic shavers came close to DE razors for acceptable results. Once you open that shaver, you'll find why!!! Well thought design. This gadget shares the same Panasonic design philosophy.
If you want to experiment; buy this one, cheap and open all  parts and see, clean, and close - capable. Looks like they deliberately designed this stripped-down version of their high end(200+$) shavers. I guess, marketing strategy. With minor modifications (alternative trimmer head); black color; extraneous packaging this becomes expensive men's shaver. So, all in all, for the stated purpose they give out a lot with this one. Comfort: Good / best amongst available. Cleanability: Very nice. Color: I like purple. It's a classy gadget. Solid construction good color. Good hold/feel. Nice power. For lazy days, remove the top cap and it becomes nice shaver that gives the looks of one-day shave. Perfect for people who like 1 to 2 mm of beard vs clean shave. Use with a good cream like Geo F Trumper and this becomes a very nice shaver too. Hint: if you have some tools, get another replacement head and file it to the thinnest feasible section and you'll get the 200+$ shaver for the cost of ~5 $ & 15 min.
Any second thoughts before buying? NONE.
Just buy it. You'll love it.

3.0,"I purchased this product based on the good reviews and I was rather disappointed. It did get the job done, sort of.

Pros:
The size is good and is easy to maneuver. Being battery-operated was nice, I didn't have to worry about the cord getting in the way.

Cons:
The plastic guard on it is very odd, it slides up and down for different lengths and it doesn't ""pick up"" the hairs to be trimmed. So most of the hair is still laying flat and doesn't get cut. It took MANY passes over the same areas and pulling the skin very taut, sometimes holding hairs straight up to get them to go through the guard, to get a half-way decent trim. It was still very uneven though.

Overall, this would be ok for touching up, but I won't be using it when I need to get the full ""haircut"". If the guards were the normal ones that snap on and off like hair clippers, this would be perfect.

(Also, do NOT use this without the guard, it will pull hairs and nick skin. Which, in my personal opinion, takes away from being a bikini trimmer. It should trim and shave.)",Not as good as I expected....,"['purchase', 'product', 'base', 'good', 'review', 'rather', 'disappointed', 'get', 'job', 'do', 'sort', 'pro', 'size', 'good', 'easy', 'maneuver', 'batteryoperate', 'nice', 'nt', 'worry', 'cord', 'get', 'way', 'con', 'plastic', 'guard', 'odd', 'slide', 'different', 'length', 'nt', 'pick', 'hair', 'trim', 'hair', 'still', 'lay', 'flat', 'nt', 'get', 'cut', 'take', 'many', 'pass', 'area', 'pull', 'skin', 'taut', 'sometimes', 'hold', 'hair', 'straight', 'get', 'go', 'guard', 'get', 'halfway', 'decent', 'trim', 'still', 'uneven', 'though', 'overall', 'would', 'ok', 'touching', 'wo', 'nt', 'use', 'need', 'get', 'full', 'haircut', 'guard', 'normal', 'one', 'snap', 'like', 'hair', 'clipper', 'would', 'perfect', 'also', 'use', 'without', 'guard', 'pull', 'hair', 'nick', 'skin', 'personal', 'opinion', 'take', 'away', 'bikini', 'trimmer', 'trim', 'shave']"

5.0,"I've had various cordless trimmers, all of them were rechargeable, and all of them lost power within a year or two and the cost of replacing the battery was almost as much as the trimmer.

This trimmer takes 2 standard AA batteries.  I use Sanyo Eneloop rechargables which are excellent.

This trimmer is very powerful for it's small size.  It fits the hand well.  Many cordless trimmers I had in the past were overly bulky.  It's a ""bikini"" trimmer, and it works great for my girlfriend, but I use it too, and we both love it.

I've trimmed my beard, my hair, and all parts and it's great.  The adjustable length mechanism works very well and is removable, as are the blades which can be removed and thoroughly cleaned (and replaced if necessary).

This product is very well designed, and at an excellent price.  I highly recommend it.

P.S. - The item doesn't come with batteries.  As I said earlier, I highly recommend Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable batteries.  They're NiMH batteries but with a new design so they keep their charge (""normal"" NiMH rechargeable batteries rapidly lose their charge entirely after only a month even when they're not being used at all).

4.0,"There was a time when I couldn't stand shaving my face. No matter what type of instrument I used-- single- and double-bladers, Norelcos, EpiLady-- after the act I usually found myself annoyed by skin irritation, razor burn, and nicks that took forever to stop bleeding. But when I tried the Mach 3, which changed the dreaded shaving ritual from a bothersome, dreadful task into... well, a less-bothersome, tolerable task. I got closer and cleaner shaves with fewer strokes than I did with previous depilatory implements, and my face didn't sting quite after the deed had been performed. I also experienced fewer nicks and cuts, helping to keep my styptic pencil bills down. Unfortunately, the max number of shaves I could ever get out of a single Mach 3 V 1.0 cartridge was six before the dullness set in (partially due to my coarse facial hair) and the lube strip began to poop out.
I was surprised by how well Gillette managed to improve on most of the Mach 3's designs with the release of the Mach 3 Turbo. Now it takes even fewer passes to get them cheeks & chin baby-bottom bare, and I've managed to make the average Turbo cartridge last through eight shaves. And thanks to the apparently-improved lube strip and that little face-stretcher thingy on the bottom part of the tri-blade, my face only feels a light sting in a stiff wind after a shave. Another great surprise: I didn't have to buy a new kit for the Turbo cartridges-- they snap right onto my original Mach 3 razor handle, no sweat!
Thanks to the Gillette Mach 3 Turbo, that semi-weekly shaving ritual I once dreaded has gone from a less-bothersome, tolerable task to... an even-less-bothersome and even-more tolerable task! Boy, if Gillette keeps improving on this product, I might one day actually find myself enjoying the act of mowin' the five-o'clock shadow!

3.0,"First and foremost, these things deliver on their promise to make your teeth ""noticeably whiter"" in two weeks.  I'm not going to complain about that.

However, I have noticed the following things:

-These things are insanely hard to get into your mouth the first few times.  It's a shame there's no ""spare"" strips included, because you're likely to waste a couple.  The lower strips especially are prone to getting crumpled up and ruined while trying to stick the damn thing to your teeth.

-The gel tastes terrible.  I recommend brushing your teeth shortly after you remove them.

-You can't really talk, drink, eat or do anything with your mouth while they're on your teeth- even swallowing is difficult at first.

-The packaging does not stress that you need to use them TWICE A DAY.  I made the mistake of using them only once a day until I luckily saw the note on the package.

4.0,"I bought this and carefully read the packet and reviews/suggestions from everyone.  Before I put them on I use a toothbrush (that I've specially designated for this) to gently scrub my teeth, then carefully put them on.  Immediately I start drooling so much, that I keep a bath towel under my face to collect everything!  Yes, it sounds gross and it is gross.  But I don't want to swallow any of that nasty taste or lose a precious whitening strip!  These things make me drool like crazy and for 30 minutes I maintain the biggest smile possible with a folded over bottom lip - to keep the lower strip in place.  Every few minutes I check with my fingernail to make sure the bottom strip is still against my teeth.  I have had no problems with tooth sensitivity (but I don't eat a lot of cold foods), burns, or anything else.  They do seem to be working.  I've been doing them at night, I'll do 2 or 3 in one sitting (the manual says that's as effective).  Then I'll stop for a few days.  As some other people have suggested, I will probably finish this package and then continue to do it maybe once a week.  I read somewhere that to appear natural, your teeth should be no whiter than the white in your eyes.

4.0,"I'm 31 years old with fairly white teeth naturally, but I am a daily coffee/tea drinker. I've used whitening packages/trays purchased from my dentist twice, but I am honestly just as pleased with the results from the Crest Whitestrips for whitening my teeth when they begin to look a bit stained. I have very sensitive teeth/gums, so I rarely use the strips more than once a day and usually have to skip a day between applications. I also use a toothpaste (like Sensodyne) when I am whitening and this eliminates most discomfort. At this point, Whitestrips are used for ""maintenance"" and I have been working on the same box for at least a year! I whiten a few time every few months and this works for me.

5.0,"I've read several comments by people who said they had trouble keeping the strips in place, I came up with a suggestion that should help anyone who happens to have that problem.

Before placing the whitestrips in place, gently pad a square of toilet paper or tissue to the front and back of your teeth, try to get those teeth as dry as possible.  Maintain a big smile so that your teeth are showing, you want to make sure that your lips don't touch them yet.  Place the whitestrips in place, one at a time, try allowing for an equal amount of strip for the front AND back of the tooth.  Push it firmly in place, and use your fingernail to gently push the front of the strip into the spaces between each tooth (to ensure that the gel makes its between each tooth, and not just the front surface).  I have found that by drying your teeth well, the strips won't move the slightest bit, compared to when I first tried them and they slid around a little.

The Whitestrips work well, I noticed a big difference after only five days.  Although my teeth weren't that stained before, I was always a little self-conscious about smiling with my mouth open when talking to people.  But now, I do it with no hesitation, and have a lot more ladies complimenting me on my smile.

5.0,"I am a dentist who recommends Crest-brand White Strips to my patients becasue they do work to whiten teeth. However, they have to be used correctly and I recommend that you follow the directions as specified inside the box.

1. Use the strips as directed on the box.  The instructions will tell you to bleach twice a day for 30-minutes a time.  The inner part of the strip has a chemical called hydrogen peroxide; (in-office, or dentist-assisted dental whitening uses a 15-35% version of the same chemical) that causes the stains inside your teeth to be oxidized and turn white. Applying the strips has a small learning curve as you will probably bend or fold a couple of them before you get the technique down.

2. Leave the strips on for the time recommended in the instructions and do not overbleach your teeth, as this leads to sensitivity.

Disadvantages

1. Hydrogen Peroxide can ""burn"" your gums. If you notice a burning sensation when you use the product, it is the chemical oxidizing (or burning) your gums (it will turn them white with a minor chemical burn). Depending on how severe the burning is, it may cause you to want to stop the treatment. It is OK to stop the treatment for a day or two to let the gums heal. Once they are healed, resume treatment with the White Strips. Try to not get the strip on your gums.

2. Your teeth may become senstiive during the week treatment time. Try to tolerate the sensitivity if it is mild, but if more severe, take a day or two off to let the teeth settle down and then pick up where you left off. You may notice much more sensitivity to cold water, ice cream, etc.  The peroxide causes a reversible inflamation of the inner pulp, or nerve center of the tooth and makes the teeth very sensitive to biting or cold drinks or foods.  If your teeth become too sensitive, back off on the strips until the sensitivity is gone before resuming bleaching.

3. The strips only cover your front teeth, so only your front teeth will bleach. You may notice the distinct difference between the back (unbleached) teeth and the front (bleached) teeth. Since most people notice the front 6 teeth anyway, this is not a big deal. However, if you have a wide toothy smile, you may want to have a dentist make you a tray that will hold the chemical on the back teeth to whiten them too.

4. The bleaching effect works best on yellow stains. If your stains are due to tetracycline (brownish grey stains in a band on your teeth, your best bet is to begin bleaching with yoru dentist and then use the strips to continue the bleaching process.

Now comes the confusing part: Crest White Strips come in 4 different packages, each a bit different than the others.  The main difference is in the strength of the hydrogen peroxide, and the price.  The higher the dose of hydrogen peroxide, the most costly the product package.  Here are the 4 packages:  1. Crest White Strips Classic (6% hydrogen peroxide, 14-day treatment).  2. Crest White Strips Premium (10% hydrogen peroxide, 7-day treatment).  3. Crest White Strips Premium Plus (10% hydrogen peroxide, and has 12 additional strips).  4. Crest White Strips Renewal (9.5% hydrogen peroxide).  The cheapest method (at around 25 dollars, is the Crest Classic Whitestrips, but it takes 2 weeks to complete the treatment).  Premium and Premium Pro are both 10% peroxide formulations, work in 7-10 days, and the ""Premuim-Plus"" gives you 12 additional strips.  I am not sure why Crest recently came out with ""Renewal"", as it is a 9.5% hydrogen peroxide formulation which is not significantly different from the 10% concentration. Leave it to the manufacturer to confuse the consumer!

Crest White Strips work for the vast majority of people. Younger people with yellow stains seem to respond better than older people or those with gray stains.

If you are not satisfied with the results and still want whiter teeth, you can then see your dentist for a more concentrated form of bleaching.  This is much more expensive, but the concentration of hydrogen peroxide is much higher and this works better on stubbornly-stained teeth.

5.0,"Originally, I was worried about the pain that many people experienced while using this product. My sister, who had used this before said she was forced to stop after a few days because the pain was too severe.

I picked up a box on sale at Bartells, and immediately tried it out.

Day 1- No pain, was very easy to apply. People had said the lower strip was hard to put on, but it went on without a hassle for me.

Day 2- No pain, but there's a strange sensation on my teeth.

Day 3- Still no pain, teeth starting to improve already, but the gums were starting to wear down.

I took one day off from wearing them then continued onwards, using them once in the morning then at night. No pain, and my gums weren't bothered ever since. This product is truly worth the money!

Only major con I can think of is that when it's time to take off the strips, you have to deal with all the gel on your teeth. At first it's a little gross, but you get used to it.

I'm guessing for people with sensitive teeth who are worried about pain, it's just how badly you want your teeth to become whitened.

5.0,"First, this product really *does* whiten teeth--it's not a gimmick as some people think. (It uses a peroxide, which is probably how your dentist would do it, although this is a less concentrated form and takes two weeks.) Of course, it only whitens natural teeth, not dental work, but for most people, they should work.

Now, on to the product itself. Some people have complained about them being difficult to apply, but after the first couple strips I didn't have any problems, and even the first time I applied it I didn't fold a strip or mess up anything major. Keep in mind that some tooth sensitivity is normal; personally, mine was only mild at worst and really only noticeable right after I applied a strip, but I know some people who aren't as lucky. If this is you, using a toothpaste for sensitive teeth may help. Also keep in mind that eating, drinking, and probably talking (unless you have better luck than I) are pretty much out of the question while you're wearing these, but I simply did one application on my drive home from work and another later in the night. My only concern was that the strips, especially the top ones, are a bit short and only cover your front eight or so teeth, but for most people that shouldn't be a problem.

A year after my first use (teeth still looking good), I am currently using a generic brand--Equate, available from Wal-Mart for about $15, about $5 less than these--and have to say that I like Crest Whitestrips better because the strips are more flexible and easier to apply, and they stay in place better. The Equate ones have a bit harder plastic and tend to slide off my teeth if I open my mouth. Hardly worth it to save $5.

It is also worth noting there are two other versions of Whitestrips: Premium and Premium Plus. Both contain a more concentrated peroxide that works in less time (7 and 10 days, respectively [the 10-day version is the same as the 7-day version but includes three extra days of strips for extra whitening], as opposed to the 14 of this Classic version) but are more expensive and--based on their reviews--seem to cause more problems with sensitivity and such. Therefore, unless you're in a hurry, I think you'd be fine with these.

In summary, I am happy with this product and think that most people would be, too.

4.0,"Crest Whitestrips are one of the most popular among the store brand tooth whitening products. They were introduced to the public in 2001 and they have been satisfying customers ever since. They work by concentrating special whitening ingredients like peroxide directly against the teeth where they can penetrate the surface for a full thirty minutes. Repeated usage for fourteen days should result in significantly whiter teeth.

Crest Whitestrips claim that these strips can be worn and used any time and that, once in place, you can go on with your normal daily routine for 30 minutes while the strips have the opportunity to work. It is true that you can do what you want, but there are certain activities that are not easy to do with one of these strips in place. I'm one of those people who has a tendency to want to move my tongue around when a have some type of dental object against my teeth and more than once, I have accidentally pushed the strips out of place. The gel helps to hold them in place but they can still be moved with little effort. Also, if you start talking with a Whitestrip in place there is a chance that some of your words will come out a little funny- like someone who has had a little too much to drink. I have found that, for best results, I try to do nothing at all when wearing Crest Whitestrips. The best thing to do is read a book. The time goes by quickly and it makes it easy to forget the strips are in place.

Waiting for fourteen days is frustrating and it is possible that you may need a second treatment after the first, depending on how well you stick to your 30 minute per day schedule and how well the Whitestrips stayed in place. But the results should make you happy. At first I avoided Crest Whitestips because of the price and because of the product itself. Spreading liquid gel on the teeth seemed much simpler than having to wear an object against one's teeth. I didn't like the idea of hassling with strips so I avoided buying Crest Whitestrips and tried the liquid variety in its various forms first. I finally gave in and purchased Crest Whitestrips because I got tired of waiting for satisfactory results. And I did get good results with these strips. I followed the advice on the package and used the upper strips twice per day first, then the lower strips twice per day for the next seven days. This is a good idea because you can compare the shade of the top teeth with the bottom, right after the upper treatment is completed. I could see a significant difference as all those years of soda pop, coffee, tea, and other staining drinks were suddenly washed away.

Crest Whitestrips use the same chemicals that dentist's use to clean and whiten teeth, so they are safe if used as directed. They are designed to keep teeth white for six months after each fourteen day period of usage. They also come with a money back guarantee. In order to get the guarantee. If you are not satisfied with the results, you can get a full refund of the purchase price provided you have followed the correct procedure for a refund.

Crest Whitestrips work well, but like other over the counter whitening products, they only work on natural tooth enamel. They will not whiten dentures, caps, crowns, or other artificial dental material. If you have teeth with artificial surfaces that are badly stained, you will need to seek the help of a dentist or other professional to get rid of the problem.

Crest Whitestrips are a little more expensive than the liquid whitening formulas but Crest Whitestrips are also more effective. I am satisfied with Crest Whitestrips and I recommend buying a box for effective treatment of discolored teeth. They are not as thorough as the treatment provided by a dentist but all things considered, these strips are a good buy.

3.0,"When I used these strips, I found that they were too flimsy, and therefore tended to bend back over themselves, making them difficult to apply.  After they were applied to the teeth, they did not always stay in place and tended to slide around.  Also, it is inconvenient to have to remove the strips, when they have done their work.  For these reasons, I do not consider them to be the best alternative.  A much better alternative is the dissolving whitening strips manufactured and distributed by CVS Pharmacy, Inc.  These strips are less flimsy/ more firm and therefore don't stick onto themselves, they adhere to your teeth far better; AND they dissolve completely in about 5-7 minutes, leaving no messy residue or plastic film to have to discard.

I understand that other people have complained that they are tricky to put on and that they were painful, but I experienced neither.

My teeth are noticeably whiter and I am very happy with the whole experience.

4.0,"I am a dentist who recommends Crest White Strips because they do work to whiten teeth.  Follow the directions in the box, and here are some further tips:

1.  (Optional step)  I recommend you first brush your teeth with water (don't use toothpaste) to remove the layer of plaque.  Your enamel has pores and the pores need to be open for the chemical to penetrate. If you use a fluoridated toothpaste, the flouride may block the enamel pores.  (Crest's instructions indicate you do not need to brush. I talked to a Crest representative on this point, and she indicated that the hydrogen peroxide will penetrate plaque, therefore this step is optional.  The instructions indicate no brushing because they do not want fluoridated toothpaste on the teeth before whitening).

2.  Use the strips twice per day for maximum efectiveness.  The inner part of the strip has a chemical called carbamide peroxide (a 6% form of hydrogen peroxide; in-office dental whitening uses a 15-30% version of the same chemical) that causes the stains inside your teeth to be oxidized and turn white.  Applying the strips has a small learning curve as you will probably bend or fold a couple of them before you get the technique down.

2.  Leave the strips on for 30 minutes at a time.  After thirty minutes your saliva has probably diluted the peroxide to the extent that it is no longer effective.  You can reapply a new strip immediately if you chose, for the treatment requires one hour of treatment time per day to work.  It does not matter if you do this in one continuous 60-minute period or two 30-minute periods.  Do this for two weeks and your teeth should get whiter.

Disadvantages

1.  The chemical may ""burn"" your gums.  If you notice a burning sensation when you use the product, it is the peroxide oxidizing (or burning) your gums.  Depending on how severe the burning is, it may cause you to stop the treatment.  It is OK to stop the treatment for a day or two to let the gums heal.  Once they feel normal again, resume treatment with the White Strips.

2.  Your teeth may become senstiive during the two-week treatment time.  Try to push yourself through the sensitivity if it is mild, but if it bothersome to cold water or air, take a day or two off to let the teeth settle down and then pick up where you left off.

3.  The strips only cover your front teeth, so only your front teeth will bleach.  You may notice the distinct difference between the back (unbleached) teeth and the front (bleached) teeth.  Since most people notice the front 6 teeth anyway, this is not a concern.  However, if you have a wide toothy smile, you may want to have a dentist make you a tray that will hold the chemical on the back teeth to whiten them too.

3.  The bleaching effect works best on yellow stains.  If your stains are due to tetracycline (brownish grey stains in a band on your teeth, your best bet is to have a dentist whiten your teeth as the dentist will use a tray to hold a more concentrated form of the chemical on your teeth for a longer period of time.

Crest White Strips work for the vast majority of people.  Over time, you will get a result that should be whiter than when you started.  Crest White Strips are a good place to start with bleaching, and if you are not satisfied with the results, you can then see your dentist for a more concentrated form of bleaching or other cosmetic options.

4.0,"I've heard a lot about them on television and on the internet, but I never gave them a try.  I'm one of those people who thinks that ALL producers simply come up with some new gimik to steal my hard earned money.

I finally met someone (with a great smile) that used them and she recommended them to me.  Gave really high reviews about them.  So, I decided to give them a try (still skeptical though.  Maybe she had a great smile to begin with).

I guess I should have taken some pictures to be sure, but personally I didn't notice much difference.  They were a bit whiter I think, but that could have been the lighting, or my imagination.

When I was done with the product, I still wasn't satisfied until I started getting compliments from all sorts of people.  People were asking me what I did, because my teeth looked really white.  Still skeptical, I ignored the first 4 people, but over 10 people can't be wrong.  Bottom line, the product does work, the ""constant shade"" of my teeth was all in my head and came from inspecting them every day.

PROS:

Product works.  Even though I skipped a couple days, still seemed to work.  Just don't inspect them so much every day, because since the difference is gradual, you won't notice much.

CONS:

The stupid strips are TOO SHORT.  What was crest thinking? I guess I just have to control my smile so that it's not too wide, because now I notice how yellow my back teeth are.  Hey, I may buy 2 boxes next time and try overlapping strips. :D

Sure you can wash it under the tap but the water causes the hair in the chamber to clump up until finally there is just a whole bunch of gunk in there thats very difficult to clean out.

4.0,"The 7825XL, 7845XL, 7865XL and 7885XL models are all basically the same razor, differing only in the way they display battery/charging  status (anywhere from 1 LED to a complete tiny LCD display).  The shaving peformance is fine for me -- not as close as a wet shave but that's a good thing for me personally because the closeness of wet shaves makes my face break out.  Every 3-7 years I buy a new Norelco and they get incrementally better each time.

I'm writing to warn about one feature.  Every shaver I'd had up to this one had a physical slider switch to turn it on and off.  This models has a push button.  This means you can't tell BY TOUCH whether it's on or off.  This is critical for me because I usually shave in the car (sitting in traffic) with the stereo blaring and I can't hear the shaver (especially since the newer models are pretty quiet).  I turn it on and off a lot as traffic conditions change.

Further, when the battery is low, my previous shavers would just run slower and slower until they came to a gradual stop.  This one slows slightly (imperceptably to me, really) and then just ""falls off the cliff"" and stops cold.  So you don't get any warning really that it's about to run out -- if I knew it was running down, then I'd shave a lot faster!

And this is where the tactile power switch feedback is important:  if the battery's totally drained, but I'm not done yet, I'll leave it off for a minute and then turn it on for 5-10 seconds of shaving before it dies again.  With the push-button power control this is really confusing because you're never really sure what's on and off.  It turns out the the power button is like a pulse that gets sent to an internal microcontroller (I'm guessing), so after it's been off for a while the power ""position"" doesn't matter, it's really off.

5.0,"After a long and arduous search, I finally found an electric shaver that does what it's suppose to do and that's to shave and do it well.

Ease of use:  This shaver is very easy to use.  A LED display tells you when it's time to recharge the battery or when it's time to clean it.  Cleaning is quite easy as well.  Just rinse it under the faucet.

Close Shave:  The shave is as close as what you get from a razor.  Shaving takes about 2-3 minutes if you shave daily.  Shaving the neck area is quite good as well.  If you wait few days, then you might have to shave few times before all the long hairs will be cut.

I tried three other products with a variety of different features (luckily most of the electric shavers comes with 30-60 day full money back guaranty) and Norelco Quadra Action stood apart.  I would suggest, you try couple of different shavers and get the one which is most comfortable for your face.

5.0,"I've had my Quadra 7886XL for three months now and really like it.  This 86XL version is intended for the discount stores and the Norelco phone rep I talked to said its the same as the 85XL except for color ..... in fact it shares the same users manuel. I purchased mine at Cosco for $90.

The shaver is a replacement for a Norelco 710RL which lasted  over 10 years.  I considered buying the low end Reflex Plus but it seemed a little too cheap and flimsey. So I decided to move up to the Quadra line and have been very pleased.

1. Its provided a very smooth and close shave without irritation from the start.  Head/blade design has come a long way in a decade. I have a VERY thick and tough beard and am able to complete a shave in 5 to 7 minutes ...... this may seem long but it took 12 to 15 minutes on my old shaver.

2. The LCD Display is great ....... remaining charge time is right there as well as a periodic cleaning reminder.  The battery does a complete recharge in about one hour and provides 40 to 43 minutes of use.

3. Its light and easy to hold.

4. The sideburn trimmer seems sturdy and does the job.

5. Cleaning with warm water once a week is a snap and it dries quickly.

6. Its very quiet.

7. The charger is built right into the power cord plug.  There's no separate unit to clutter the sink top when recharging.

My only gripe is that Norelco does not provide a hard case for the shaver.  The soft travel bag is OK for packing on trips but isn't convenient for use in the house. The shaver has a small flat spot on the back and can be placed on a shelf but if you have to put it into a sliding drawer it has a tendency to rock over on its side. Oh well, you can't have everything!

Bottom line: this shaver is the real deal.

4.0,"I have had a Braun, then a Remington, neither of which were particularly impressive.  The Remington provided a very close shave for nearly three years, but soon after the 1 year warranty on that thing was up, the battery no longer held a charge, and the trimmer quit working.  I decided to give it up for the pricier Norelco as I have this vision of Norelco being the Cadillac of the bunch.

I have had the Norelco 7885 now for about 5 months.  It works well and is reliable.  I particularly like the digital display that indicates when you need to properly wash it.  The fact that the shaver is water proof makes cleaning it a breeze.  The battery charge is excellent offering me 35 minutes of shaving time on a full charge (which takes only about 2 hours). The only problem I have is that I wish the shave were a little closer - it still provides a good shave, but it does seem as though my 5 o'clock shaddow comes a little earlier since I switched to the Norelco.

Firstly, I'm not sure why I was more fortunate than most others writing their reviews, but the battery in my norelco, although it is about a year old, lasts me a good 50 minutes of shaving for every time I charge it. It exceeds what the manual claimed. Also, for me, it does not take a full day to let the water dry. After I have thoroughly rinsed it clean, I close the head, (and no, my head does not fly off like others have said) and shake it well, then open the head, and let it dry. It takes maybe a few hours, not much more. Also, if I blow in it for about 3 seconds, before I let it dry, it seems to blow all the large droplets out, so it dries quicker.

4.0,"This is the latest shaver in Norelco's Quadra system.  The shaving heads are mounted in such a way that gives them the freedom to depress independently of one another, to better adapt to the unique contours of your face.  Another advantage to this razor is that the shaving heads can be washed under the faucet.  This is a feature that the Quadra system razors share with the more expensive Spectra system razors.
This razor is light-years better than my previous Norelco.  My last Norelco was the 885, bought back in 1991.  That razor always irritated my skin, especially the neck area.  Although it did last nine years.  Three years ago, I switched to the Braun Syncro system.  The Braun worked very well for me.  Anyway, I decided to give Norelco another try.  I was very surprised, and impressed, to say the least.  This Quadra shaves just as close and just as comfortable as the Braun Syncro.  And, it is very quiet.  So far, I am only getting 35 minutes of shaving time per charge.  But, I believe that the battery will reach its full capacity after a few more discharge and charge cycles.
For me, it is an even choice between this Norelco and the Braun.  I can readily recommend either one.  I suppose you just might have to try both and see which one will work better for you.  One thing is obvious though.  Either one will save you money in the long run, compared to using a blade shaver like the Mach 3, for example.  The long-term cost of periodically buying replacement blades for a Mach 3 or Sensor Excel can easily exceed the price of either one of the electrics.

5.0,"I've been a sceptic of electric razors for years, preferring a blade shave while more and more friends told me that they've come a long way with electrics.  My wife got me this Norelco for Christmas and it has completely sold me.
First, shave quality is very good.  You can either enjoy a good shave in under a minute or else give a few extra moments (3, maybe 4 minutes max for me) and get near-blade-quality closeness.  Either option leaves you with no mess to clean up and no cuts or irritation.  The user manual recommends that you use the shaver exclusively for the first month so that your skin can get used to the shaver.  This is also good a good time for the user to get his technique down - you do need to figure out which way your beard grows on all parts that you shave.  During this period, I also noticed that you need less and less pressure as your face gets acclimated, so the comfort just gets better and better.
So maybe all electrics deliver a good shave these days - what makes this one stand out?  First and foremost, ease of use.  The Quadra rinses clean under hot water and even displays on the LCD when it needs to be cleaned.  It also shows how many minutes of charge that you have remaining;  recharging the unit to a full 40 minutes takes less than an hour and you can use it while it charging with the included cord.

Although certain areas of my face were easy to cut, I just couldn't get the shaver to  get the short hairs on my chin and neck.  I would spend at least five minutes on those areas alone.  Thinking it was just a face thing and that, eventually my skin would adjust, I carried on past the trial period until well over a month of use.  Finally, I gave up, took the shaver back, and tried the Norelco Quadra.  What a difference!  The Quadra took to my skin immediately and within two days, I was getting almost every hair that the BSS wasn't.  So now I'm a faithful Norelco fan.

5.0,The Norelco 7885XL Quad action shaver is the best I have ever used. In the past I have tried everything from other shavers to razor blades. The Braun and Remington shavers were a joke. They never seemed to give me the close shave with no irritation that I desired. I have very sensitive skin so going to a blade was a hard decision but I tried the Mach 3 turbo. As far as blades go they aren't bad and give a close shave but for my sensitive skin no way. Not to mention they get a little pricy as people know who use the Mach 3. Then I tried the Norelco and I never looked back. 1) close shave 2) no irritation 3) extremely easy to clean 4) initial cost may seem high but in long run saves alot of money 5) not that it matters much but looks very stylish.

I figured it wouldn't be as close of a shave, and I was right, however it was a close enough shave to where I deem it worth keeping.  Plus it's a ton more comfortable, and it shaves quicker than an ordinary blade. I can get my face done in less than 5 minutes instead of 10 minutes with a blade).  With no need to change heads every 3-4 times this razor will pay for itself vs. those blades that keep getting more expensive.

They are right though, the electric razor will need a minimum of 2 weeks to get used to your face properly before you will get its full effect.

I am Asian, don't have much to shave to start with, so this is very disappointing.  It took over 5 min of shaving to get a point where I thought my face felt good.  This shaver does NOT irritate at all, which is a good thing, considering I have really sensitive skin.  Just for fun, I shaved my face again with my Braun Synchro, to my surprise, I heard cutting noise...  Apparently, the Braun can save even closer than the Norelco.  After a quick shave with the Braun Synchro, my face felt even more smooth.  I am not pro Braun per se, but it seems the Braun Synchro shaves way better.  One more thing, if you keep certain facial hair, like goatee, you will find the big head of the Norelco to be a problem, you can't get a precision shave, where as the Braun has a narrow rectangle shaving surface, is much easier to control.

5.0,"I concur that previous reviews of the Norelco Quadra Action 7885 posted on Amazon.com were not reflective of this product's true performance. I have owned other Norelco models, as well as Brauns, and I find the new Norelco Quadra Action to be a superior shaver. At first I, too, was skeptical about the mix of slots and holes in the shaving head. I thought this may be a marketing gimmick. After significant use of this shaver, I have found that it does in fact shave closer than any other electric shaver I have used, including two previous Braun foil shavers.
I also agree with an earlier reviewer who questioned the need for lotion-dispensing shavers, and shavers that must be cleaned in a special container with  a proprietary cleaning solution. I think this is just additional cost that does not contribute to increased shaving performance. The new Norelcos' can be simply rinsed clean under warm running water, with no need for elaborate cleaning devices or costly cleaning solutions. I have found that it takes 2-3 recharging cycles until the LCD meter ""learns""
and then accurately reports the remaining shaving time left, however, it is now fairly accurate. The unit holds sufficient charge for approximately 45 minutes of cordless shaving per one-hour recharge. The built-in reminder in the LCD display to clean the shaver is nice, but I generally rinse the unit after each shave anyway.  I do not see an appreciable difference between this shaver and the Norelco Spectra model, other than the significant cost. Save the extra $ and purchase the Quadra Action.

5.0,"This shaving machine is a member of the Reflex series that made its advent to the market in 1998 (if I'm not mistaken) . Ever since , there have been a few upgrades to this same basic feature of floating shave heads in the form of the Deluxe Quadra Action , the Deluxe Advantage Wet/Dry and the latest Spectra top of the line .
Before purchasing the 5810XL I have done a market survey to come up with the conclusion that these upgrades are too expensive , and do not necessarily worth their higher price tag : Okay , so you can shave your face in the bath , while you're wet . So what ? Why would I want to do that ? Another upgrade is the LCD indication scale that shows the state of the battery (5841XL). It's nice , but paying an additional 20 - 30 bucks for that ? I'm not sure .
The only extra cash I would be willing to pay is for better shaving results . In this field the innovations are shaped in the form of the two stage blade system (6891XL and the 6826XL , to name a few versions) and the lotion/gel dispensing system (6756X) that sounds promising but are respectively expensive (at least , for me) . The newest line mentioned above is the over-priced (but maybe well deserved) Spectra line that strikes me as made for rich only .
To say a few words about the Reflex system , this is the heart of the machine and it includes three razors that are floating in their place and flexing to enable the closest shave possible , by fitting to the facial contours . As for the 5810's Reflex system performance , it certainly delivers ; I'm experiencing much closer and better shaves than ever (I used a 4681 before and reviewed it as well) , and can sincerely confirm the superiority of this product over its predecessors .
By choosing the 5810XL you acquire a durable and trustworthy product that pays .

4.0,"I've gone through three beard trimmers in the past few years, and the Norelco 990 is - after two weeks of use - certainly better than the rest in performance, and equal to the best (the Panasonic) in quality.
The adjustment ring is easy-to-use and well-designed, and the swiveling comb/guard above the blades is an excellent design enhancement.  The trimmer cuts smoothly, consistently and evenly.  That you can use this trimmer in either corded or cordless mode is a very big asset.  The carrying case is a nice plus as well.
My only complaint is the pop-up trimmer, which is awkward to engage and seems a bit flimsy.  It works fairly well but is not as easy to use as the pop-up trimmers on the Norelco rotary shavers.
So far, I've used this trimmer every other day for two weeks on a single charge, and the LED shows that the batteries are still three-quarters charged.  This translates to two months on a single charge for me, and that would be excellent.
I'd say it's safe to spend the extra bucks for this model; it's apparently worth it.",Good Quality and Good Performance,"['go', 'three', 'beard', 'trimmer', 'past', 'year', 'norelco', 'two', 'week', 'use', 'certainly', 'well', 'rest', 'performance', 'equal', 'good', 'panasonic', 'quality', 'adjustment', 're', 'easytouse', 'welldesigne', 'swivel', 'combguard', 'blade', 'excellent', 'design', 'enhancement', 'trimmer', 'cut', 'smoothly', 'consistently', 'evenly', 'use', 'trimmer', 'either', 'cord', 'cordless', 'mode', 'big', 'asset', 'carry', 'case', 'nice', 'plus', 'well', 'complaint', 'popup', 'trimmer', 'awkward', 'engage', 'seem', 'bit', 'flimsy', 'work', 'fairly', 'well', 'easy', 'use', 'popup', 'trimmer', 'norelco', 'rotary', 'shaver', 'far', 'use', 'trimmer', 'every', 'day', 'two', 'week', 'single', 'charge', 'lead', 'show', 'battery', 'still', 'threequarter', 'charge', 'translate', 'two', 'month', 'single', 'charge', 'would', 'excellent', 'say', 'safe', 'spend', 'extra', 'buck', 'model', 'apparently', 'worth']"
5.0,"The features on this beard timmer are well thought which makes the whole package rather satisfying.
The depth selection mechanism works via rotating ring which means that pressure on the guard won't change the cutting height (like my old trimmer).  The flexing guard is very comfortable and natural feeling.
The unit charges in an hour and holds its charge well.  A long overdue trim (from furry to chic) didn't even register on the battery meter.
I don't find much use for the secondary fine trimming head.  It does cut closer than the primary cutter so you can clean up the trimmed areas without having to shave afterwards.

It didn't seem to even touch the hairs around my sideburns, and no matter how many times I ran the edge over my skin, nothing seemed to happen.

5.0,"I love this shaver.  Have had it for ten year.  Bought it when ""Die Another Day"" came out.  Looks like I'll be replacing it now the ""Skyfall"" has come out.  This shaver has functioned flawlessly for the ten years I've owned it.  Till this morning, it charged up to 133 minutes.  Of course, today, with 103 minutes left on the display and with no other warning (like a weakened battery), it just stopped.  Pressing the power button displays ""0 mins used"" followed by ""103 mins left"".  I tried fully charging the unit.  No luck there.  It doesn't even work on the cord.  Talked to Philips support, and they say that this just happens with that style of rechargable battery.

Anyway, I have a backup low-end Norelco that I bought a year ago during a Target deal - it cost $10 after rebate and had a set of heads (ones I thought were these HQ8, but which were, IIRC, HQ5 - far inferior).  The good news, I can use the HQ8s in that cheap shaver - it's designed to be an easy upgrade.  Too bad the battery in the cheap model is also cheap, as it doesn't last but a week between charges.

5.0,I own two of these and 10 years on they still function flawlessly.  If I could find another for sale I would snap it up - Norelco never made another shaver with the heft of this one again.

5.0,"I bought this shaver almost 10 years ago. In that time, I tried a Panasonic Arc shaver (wet/dry) which was very good but broke after about 2 years. I came back to this one and it's still going strong.

When I first bought it, I didn't think the LCD display was needed, but I have come to love the minute readout. More impressive is the battery life. After 10 years, I get between 120 and 130 minutes of time with a 1 hour charge. This is 2-3 times what the current top end shavers get from various manufacturers. It also means you can go on vacation and not worry about bringing a cord.

The other great feature is the sound level. It's one of the quietest shavers I've used.

Shave quality is very good, but it takes a good 5 minutes to get a really good shave. Still not blade close of course, but very good. Speaking of blades, the price for new heads is not that bad either. I have found them on Amazon for under $30 and can easily get 1-2 years. Compared to the nicer blade shavers, that's not bad at all.

5.0,"No electric shaver is going to get as close as a manual razor. But this one impressed me a lot. It got very close. I couldn't even feel any stubble, which most electric shavers leave. Does it provide as close a shave as a $7 razor? No. But it's not far off. And it's much more convenient.

I didn't have any problems with the battery. In fact, I was very impressed by it. I'm not very hairy, so I only use 1-2 minutes at a time. I let the battery drain, and then charged it fully. I then used it for about over a year without charging it once. Amazing. Granted, I only shave about 3-5 times a week, and each time for only about a minute or two, but still, that's very impressive. Even when the indicator said ""0"" and advised me to recharge it, I didn't. I was still able to get a few more months of shaving at ""0 minutes left.""

5.0,"I bought this Norelco Spectra Deluxe Electric Shaver 8894XL about 10 years ago given the excellent reviews, and despite its dazzling price of approximately $200. Like I would imagine many to initially be, I was slightly skeptical, But as long as one frequently washes out the accumulated hair and debris from shaving the face, this razor will do the job that it is designed to do--the razor is absolutely worth the price. The rotating cutters are sharp and they deliver a smooth shave. I use ""Williams Lectric Shave"" as the pre-shave lotion. The razor can be used while wet, it is easy to clean, and the screen shows how many minutes you used up during that particular shaving (hahaha) and how many minutes there are left before the need for recharging. Some of the information that appears on the screen can look frivolus, such as icons to show that the razor requires cleaning or that the heads require replacing. But the heads function efficiently for a very long time before you feel that they should be replaced---maybe the replacement icon is a bit of a marketing ploy--the set of replacement heads costs about $30. Like many Norelcos of that kind, this one has a trimmer in the back--good for trimming the mustache and edge hairs. All in all this is a fun and efficient electric razor that is the best that I have ever had. The only notable wear and tear on mine is the rubber wearing and tearing off in the area of the swith--but is normal depreciation from long-term use.","Heavily Automated, Durable and Efficient Norelco Razor","['buy', 'norelco', 'spectra', 'deluxe', 'electric', 'shaver', 'xl', 'year', 'ago', 'give', 'excellent', 'review', 'despite', 'dazzle', 'price', 'approximately', 'like', 'would', 'imagine', 'many', 'initially', 'slightly', 'skeptical', 'long', 'one', 'frequently', 'wash', 'accumulate', 'hair', 'debris', 'shaving', 'face', 'razor', 'job', 'design', 'razor', 'absolutely', 'worth', 'price', 'rotate', 'cutter', 'sharp', 'deliver', 'smooth', 'shave', 'use', 'williams', 'lectric', 'shave', 'preshave', 'lotion', 'razor', 'use', 'wet', 'easy', 'clean', 'screen', 'show', 'many', 'minute', 'use', 'particular', 'shaving', 'hahaha', 'many', 'minute', 'left', 'need', 'recharge', 'information', 'appear', 'screen', 'look', 'frivolus', 'icon', 'show', 'razor', 'require', 'clean', 'head', 'require', 'replace', 'head', 'function', 'efficiently', 'long', 'time', 'feel', 'replace', 'maybe', 'replacement', 'icon', 'bit', 'marketing', 'ploy', 'set', 'replacement', 'head', 'cost', 'like', 'many', 'norelcos', 'kind', 'one', 'trimmer', 'back', 'good', 'trim', 'mustache', 'edge', 'hair', 'fun', 'efficient', 'electric', 'razor', 'good', 'ever', 'notable', 'wear', 'tear', 'mine', 'rubber', 'wear', 'tear', 'area', 'swith', 'normal', 'depreciation', 'longterm', 'use']"

I took the leap of faith about 5 years ago and have never onc regretted the decision.  The 8894XL still holds about 120 minutes of charge and shaves just about as good as a careful blade shave (minus the nicks and cuts).  The reminder feature (minutes left on charge, clean reminder, and blade replace reminder) looked like gimmicks when I bought it, but have turned out to be very worthwhile features.

I've used cheap ($50) electric razors before and they are pathetic compared to this.  It's pretty darn close to a real razor in places, if you work it.  Charge life is seriously amazing.  I can go well over a month, maybe even 2, before having to charge this thing from using 6 times a week.  The closeness dial is useful when you have extra long stubble or sensitive areas.  Other than that I leave it at 0 (closest).

The display counts down the remaining charge and is pretty accurate.  It tells you when it needs cleaned out under the faucet, great.

The heads have lasted until now (5 years) and I got a warning on the display telling me to replace the heads.

3.0,"I've always tried to buy the best electric razor when the time comes.  I had a Grundig Rolltronic Pro (garbage), a Braun 7505 and now I have been using the Norelco Spectra 8894XL for several months.  Despite all the positive reviews, I have given up on the Spectra and gone back to the Braun 7505.  The main problem with the Spectra is that it irritates your neck.  The first time I shaved, my neck was actually all bloody.  Even after trying every sensitivity setting, it still tends to cause red marks and irritation on the neck.  After switching back to the Braun my neck is healthy again.  Another problem that others have pointed out is that the 3 head design is hard to clean and makes it difficult to cut side burns.  Also the trimmer is terrible because of its placement and lack of cutting ability.  The Spectra is also twice the size of the Braun which is a bit of a nuisance on trips.  On the plus side, the Spectra has excellent battery life.  Furthermore, the Spectra is better than the Braun if you go several days without shaving.

5.0,"...it's good enough for an average everyday man like myself.

I suffered for a few years using a Braun. The Braun used to cause cuts. A friend told me that electric razors shouldn't be cutting skin. I wasn't doing anything wrong when I shaved, either. Puzzled, I decided to invest in one of these. It was much more expensive than the Braun it replaced, but so far has been worth it.

My shave times have been cut in half and the only redness I usually get on my skin nowadays is from sunburn. This razor doesn't cut skin, and actually seems to work best when it's wet. There's no cleaning base for this like there was for the Braun, since it can be cleaned simply by running water under it.

I've actually gotten smoother shaves with this than I've gotten with manual razors. Stubborn hair can usually be removed by wetting the head and then going over the area.

Chargewise it does well. There have been some reports of early models not being able to hold a charge, but it seems as if that has been fixed. The batteries are usually good for about five or six years according to owners of previous Norelco models.

5.0,"I had a Norelco years ago, then I went through three Brauns (the micro-foil ones that a straight instead of having three circular blades like this one).  All my razors were expensive, they were all the best in the bunch.  This is the best by far.

This razor shaves close, I have never felt my skin so smooth except when I used to use a blade.  It conforms to your skin, even my neck comes out smooth (about 4 minutes to completely shave smooth, or I'll usually shave for less than a minute and get a shave that lasts until I get home from work).  It has a timer that not only tells you exactly how many minutes of battery are left, but it also tells you how many minutes you shaved for (which comes in handy more than I thought it would).  The best feature is that you can pop the top up and rinse it in water!  My brauns cleaned with refil cartridges that were hard to find and expensive and a hassel; whereas my old Norelco cleaned with a brush and never got really clean.  This one cleans easily and quickly, and even beeps to tell you when to clean it!  Also, this razor doesn't give me razor burn like my Brauns did!!

4.0,"I bought this shaver from amazon after reading a number of the reviews and giving some thought to the issues that people have had.  I have really dark and very coarse (in my girlfriend's opinion) facial hair and usually by noon I have a 5-oclock shadow so I was looking for great things from the new Norelco.  For the past 10 years or so I have used two other Norelco shavers, each the top of the Norelco line when I bought them.  The most recent was the 5885XL which I've had since it was the latest and greatest from Norelco and until the motor recently burned out.  So I bought this model after considering switching to a Braun shaver.  In the end I had not been convinced that the technology behind the Braun would actually shave closer.

So now that I've had the new Norelco for a few months I have to say that while it is a great shaver I am not convinced that it is much better than any of the other lower priced models currently offered.  For the first week it was an amazingly close shave but in the weeks and months following it reminded me of my previous shaver.  It too shaved really well the first week.  One hassle that I had read in the reviews and ignored is the placement of the spring-loaded head release button and the fact that shavings don't remain in the head during normal use.  About once a week or two while shaving I've accidentaly pressed on the head release button which springs open and gets shavings all over the place.  If you buy this shaver, plan on cleaning it out more often than it tells you to clean it out.  Otherwise shavings will find their way out one way or another.  Improvements I do think this model has over previous years are in the Pros below.  Don't get me wrong...this is a good shaver.  But I think if you were to buy a lower model it would still shave the same though it wouldn't have the nicely designed look and LED display.

Pros

Battery Life

new cutting wheels with holes and slits (I have no proof that this gives me a closer shave but it seems to make sense that it would)

Styling

Cons

Placement of head release button

The lower models are probably just as close a shave and much less expensive

4.0,"I switched to the 8894XL from a Braun Synchro shaver that I had used about 3 years or so.

With the Braun, I was spending a lot of money on cleaning cartridges, foils, and cutters (I would guess about $10-15 a month).

Compare that to this Norelco, which I've now been using for one year. I have yet to replace the cutters, and maintenance with simple running water has been a breeze. Although there is a please-wash-me indicator that seems to appear weekly, I wash it every 3 to 5 days.

The Norelco feels a little bit rough on my neck, and it leaves a bit of irritation. But, it shaves closer than the Braun, and the Braun would occasionally cut my face (which was my first indication that the foil needed to be replaced) -- I have not had this problem with the Norelco. Directly after shaving, I either shower or splash some water on my neck, which stops the irritation.

The battery lasts a surprisingly long time between charges, around one to two months per charge for me. This is awesome! I do not typically have to pack the charger when I am on travel.

After a year of use, I am still very happy with this shaver.

5.0,"Hi all

This is my first product review and I have never endorsed a product before...

I think you can call me an old-hand in electrical shavers.  I started to shave in 1978 using a Remington electrical shaver. My first Phillips/Norelco shaver was a gift from my grandfather in 1983.

Since then I have bought 5-6 Phillips shavers in succession (a new one every 3-4 years). They require no maintenance except for cleaning, a yearly head change and 2 year battery change. With each new shaver the shaving gets better and it is difficult to see any improvements that can be made in these machines. But they DO get them to shave better.

In the meanwhile I got several other brand shaving machines as gifts (Wet, Grid etc) but after experimenting for a few days I always resumed shaving with the Phillips dry shavers. I am not a fan of wet-electrical shavers (even Phillips).

I have had the Spectra 8894 for two months now. This one is a wonder and I strongly recommend it.

5.0,"I picked one of these up 2 months ago after reading hundreds of reviews on Amazon.com.  My previous razor was an extremely old Norelco 4816 XL.  It did a great job for many years had a few major problems; the battery died and no longer would hold a charge, when my beard got long it would painfully pull the hairs from my face rather than cut them, it took longer and longer to finish a shave (I only replaced the blades about 3 times in ~8 years), and the blades would get really hot on my face causing a lot of irritated skin.

This new 8894 XL addresses all of these problems.  The new 2-stage shaving (holes and slots) takes care of 99% of the painful pulling on my long beard.  The floating heads and general quality of the product result in a shorter shave than before (8-10 mins is now 3-5 minutes).  This along with the materials used helps to keep the blades from heating up and irritating my face.  And finally, this won't be known for a few years, but hopefully the Lithium ion battery will hold up longer and perform better than my old NiCa battery.  I've already noticed that it doesn't seem to slow the whole shave down to a crawl nearly as much as the old one (when it's getting low).

Finally for some things that I was always happy with; the pop up trimmer still comes in very handly.  As some others have stated it does seem to fold back and forth sometimes when you don't want it to, but you can get used to it.  It also seems to be much more effective than my old trimmer ever was.  Both razors fit very nicely in the hand and the new one even seems to be better contoured.  Also I love the freedom of shaving in any direction since I have facial hair going in all directions.  This was one of the major things that made me stay with Norelco rather than trying out one of the straight-line foil razors.

Unlike many other men who love their old blades, I've always been a big fan of electric razors and have detested using a blade.  So when it came time to buy a new razor I was looking for yet another that I was confident that I could use for 5-10 years to come.  I feel very strongly that I made the right choice with this razor.

Then tried a braun flat head, that made my face go red.

5.0,"I was very happy with my Norelco Reflex Action 5885XL, which died after about 6 years of use. I opted for a new top-of-the-line Norelco because I knew it would last me for many years to come. I originally hesitated... $180 is a LOT of money for a razor, even for a Norelco. So, I set my expectations high.

After a year-and-a-half of use, I can honestly say that it is a great razor. It gives me a closer shave than my old Reflex Action and is less harsh on my skin (note: I do like to use a pre-electric shave gel, which makes for a much smoother shave anyway). Prior to purchase, I was most anxious about the closeness of the shave. I wasn't disappointed.

Next to the shave quality, other features are much less important to me. However, the easy cleaning feature is extremely convenient and does save a lot of extra time. The battery life is nothing less than amazing, though perhaps a bit overkill. If you want to save $50, buy a lower-end Spectra and you'll probably have to charge it once a month instead of once every two months. Big deal. Personally, I opted for the flagship model because I know I'm going to use it forever.

This, all in spite of being initially turned off by the high price and James Bond tie-in (funny, when I was a Bond fan years ago I was too young to shave anyway).

3.0,"I would have thought, due to the high price of this shaver, that it would give just an outstanding shave. Not so. Like another recent reviewer, I have a heavy beard, and the shaver really struggles with it.

I should mention that I'm not a new user. I've now owned mine for over a year. If you read the reviews, you'll see that there have been quality problems with batteries in this model. I got one of the bad ones. Norelco exchanged it under warranty. Annoying, but they didn't give me a hard time. The new unit's battery has behaved flawlessly, and holds a charge good for an absurdly large number of shaves.

Besides the long battery life, a feature I *LOVE* is the ability to clean it under the sink. That is really handy, and not just hype.

I haven't seen any mentions in other reviews of replacement shaving heads. Norelco recommends that you replace them yearly. Like the shaver itself, they're very costly. However, after I replaced them, I did notice an immediate improvement in the feel and quality of the shave.

I think as you read the other reviews here, you may come to the conclusion, as I have, that if you have a heavy beard, this unit will give you a very good, but not great, shave. Combine that with the high initial cost of the unit and the high cost of yearly shaving head replacement, and I can recommend this only if you have a light to medium beard and really must have an electric.

Instead, I STRONGLY recommend that you check out the Gillette M3Power razor if you want the best quality shave. It seems like a gimmick, but it works.

5.0,"Hi,

 Norelcos are most likely the best razors available. But while reading some reviews I noticed several people having the same problem of very low battery life, followed by blanking display and abrupt stop. I hope the following may help. I have had two Norelco razor exhibit the same problems. In both, the problem was traced to a bad connection between the battery and the board. [Short metal stub soldered between the battery connection and the board] The batteries can be fully charged but if the circuit is intermittenly broken (vibration, heat due to amp draw while in use...) The circuit will immediatly drop the battery level display output and show discharged or no display and stop. Usually the razor will reset but will now show the batteries as flat, thus requiring a new full charging cycle. If this unit is in warranty seek service! If not you can open the razor and re-solder these connections to solve the problem. Good-Luck!",Battery Drop Out,"['hi', 'norelcos', 'likely', 'good', 'razor', 'available', 'read', 'review', 'notice', 'several', 'people', 'problem', 'low', 'battery', 'life', 'follow', 'blank', 'display', 'abrupt', 'stop', 'hope', 'follow', 'may', 'help', 'two', 'norelco', 'razor', 'exhibit', 'problem', 'problem', 'trace', 'bad', 'connection', 'battery', 'board', 'short', 'metal', 'stub', 'solder', 'battery', 'connection', 'board', 'battery', 'fully', 'charge', 'circuit', 'intermittenly', 'break', 'vibration', 'heat', 'due', 'amp', 'draw', 'use', 'circuit', 'immediatly', 'drop', 'battery', 'level', 'display', 'output', 'show', 'discharged', 'display', 'stop', 'usually', 'razor', 'reset', 'show', 'battery', 'flat', 'thus', 'require', 'new', 'full', 'charge', 'cycle', 'unit', 'warranty', 'seek', 'service', 'open', 'razor', 'resolder', 'connection', 'solve', 'problem', 'goodluck']"
2.0,"I was initially impressed with this shaver.  The shave was very comfortable and close.  And it rinsed clean!  Or so I thought.  I dilgently rinsed the shaver under the faucet after every shave.  However, after a few weeks, it needed hand cleaning.  I opened the shaver, and cleaned the the heads.  The design of the shaver heads made it virtually impossible to replace them properly.  I finally got the heads in correctly, or so I thought!  The shaver never operated correctly after that.  I struggled for quite a while and could never get it right.  I finally gave up and returned it to Norelco.  Hopefully, my refund will be processed soon.  I purchased the Remington as a replacement.  Its shave is not as comfortable, but it is adequate, and it has its own cleaning system which doesn't require hand cleaning.","Initially impressed, then disappointed","['initially', 'impress', 'shaver', 'shave', 'comfortable', 'close', 'rinse', 'clean', 'think', 'dilgently', 'rinse', 'shaver', 'faucet', 'every', 'shave', 'however', 'week', 'need', 'hand', 'clean', 'open', 'shaver', 'clean', 'head', 'design', 'shaver', 'head', 'make', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'replace', 'properly', 'finally', 'get', 'head', 'correctly', 'think', 'shaver', 'never', 'operate', 'correctly', 'struggle', 'quite', 'could', 'never', 'get', 'right', 'finally', 'give', 'return', 'norelco', 'hopefully', 'refund', 'process', 'soon', 'purchase', 'remington', 'replacement', 'shave', 'comfortable', 'adequate', 'clean', 'system', 'nt', 'require', 'hand', 'clean']"
5.0,"Let me start by stating that I am not nor have I ever been a spoksman for Norelco but you would not know that if you could hear me talk about this shaving system.

I have been a safty razor user for over thirty years but had heard great things about this product.  So I figured with a money back guarantee it couldn't hurt to give it a try.

Right out of the box I pluged it in and gave it a test drive.  I don't recomend everyone do this since the instructions indicate it should be fully charged first.  But it didn't seem to harm the unit and I got the best shave I have ever had!

EVER!!!

It came with instructions on how to charge the battery then run down all the power and recharge.  This has to do with the type of battery the unit has.  I know it didn't take long to charge, but I was like a kid on Christmas that just got his favorite toy and could hardly wait to play with it.

I took the time to read the manual and check out all the features.  It is a very easy unit to use.  Even for me who had never used an electric razor.

I like the ""Polymer LED"" window.  Very easy to read and understand.  I think the best feature for me is being able to rinse it clean right there at the sink.

The travel bag will come in handy since I will be traveling a lot in the next few months.  I will have to see how well the protective cap for the blades works out when I travel.  It does seem to fit rather loosely but I would think if it were too snug it may, over time, harm the blades.

The little stand that comes with it does seem a little useless as stated in a previous review.  But because I have enough space at my sink to store the unit, I don't need the stand at all so it will more than likely get tossed very soon.

As for the quality of the shave....I can't say enough.  The packaging itself along with Amazon.com and Norelco's websites state that two or three weeks should be allowed for your skin and beard to adjust to the unit.  My skin and beard adjusted instantly!  I always thought I was destined to have a constant five o'clock shadow because every time I would shave with a regular razor, you could still see the outline of where my beard grew.  With this Norelco Spectra 8, I actually look like I shaved and it stays that way throughout the day.

Again, I promise you I am not a spokesman for Norelco.  I am just an extremely satisfied customer!

Thank you for listening.

5.0,"FINAL UPDATE:  I have had this razor for more than one year now.  It continues to do an excellent job and the battery capacity gets better each time the unit is charged.  I just charged it this morning and the final charge capacity read, ""121 minutes""!  THIS IS AN UPDATED REVIEW.  I HAVE NOW USED THIS RAZOR FOR APPROXIMATELY 2 1/2 MONTHS.  The second full charge provided shaving from 16 SEP through 27 OCT.  The initial charge ran from 10 AUG through 15 SEP.  That's a total of 2 1/2 months worth of shaving on only two charges!  When I recharged the unit for the third time, the screen once again read ""103 minutes"".  I would not have thought it possible, but the shaves are even better now.....very smooth and fast!  This is an amazing product!  BEGIN ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I purchased the 8894XL Spectra razor from Amazon.com and received it on 10 AUG 04.  I almost did not purchase the unit because of several negative reviews about possible battery problems.  However, there were so many positive reviews that I decided to take a chance....and I am VERY happy I did.  When I received the razor, I followed the directions about charging the unit.  When it was fully charged, the screen read ""100 minutes"" of shaving time.  I first used the unit on 10 AUG and the first battery charge lasted through 15 SEP, 37 days of shaving!  I gave the unit a 1-hour charge today and the screen read ""103"" minutes.  So much for the alleged battery problems!  I transitioned to the Norelco from a Braun screen razor and the difference is amazing.  The Norelco is MUCH more quiet (you can hardly hear it) and the shaving is much more comfortable (from the first day of use).  The Norelco is also MUCH faster.  Shaving times range from two to three minutes each day.  Some people who have purchased this razor have complained about the plastic cutter protector not staying on the unit.  I originally thought the same thing, but have solved the problem.  Just keep rotating the plastic cover around the head until you find the side with the tightest fit.  After that, just place the plastic cover on your sink counter so that you can put it back on the razor the same way.

2.0,"I bought my first Philips razor in 1959 in Germany and have used the Norelco brand since then.  Each time I buy a new Norelco razor, they seem to get cheaper.  My old 5184 (at least six years old) is made much better than the 8894XL.  The old 5184 has traveled a lot and been banged around, yet, it is still in great shape.

I purchased a new razor for the longer battery time and for a better shave. The battery on the 8894 does last much longer and the shave is a little bit better.

But, the 8894 has a very cheap head with a flimsy hinge and latch. The slightest bump and the head pops open. The trimmer is so flimsy I need to support it with my thumb to keep it from closing. The plastic guard for the head is so poorly made that it will not stay on. The 110/220 function is in the head of the cord making for a large lump in the bag.  The 110/220 function belongs in the razor where is was in the past.

The best constructed part of the razor package is the case. The case is as good or better than the case for my digital camera.

4.0,"There are two great elements about this particular shaver. The first is that it is quiet. After using a Panasonic wet/dry, that sounded like an outboard motor, this Norelco can be used in a library. Very nice. The other great element is the closeness of the shave, which is excellent.

I've always liked the ""triple head"" configuration of the Norelco shavers and this one is the best yet, with the settings for more sensitivity, and the heads that flex with your face so you don't miss anything. For me, the ""normal"" setting is sensitive enough to use, but it's nice to know you can make adjustments if needed.

The battery life is quite good; I took it on a recent three week business trip and only needed to charge it once!

My only criticism of the product is about the trimmer attached. It really doesn't do a wonderful job. It's not horrible, but it's just not as good as the rest of the shaver. The trimmer is a bit small and awkward to handle. I still keep my old Panasonic around when I want to do trimming! Otherwise, it was well worth the investment!

4.0,"Quite a while back my Remington Microscreen needed the screen replaced, and for a few dollars more than the cost of the screen I bought Norelco's bottom-end cordless.  It was under-powered, seemed like it was always at the end of the 30-minute shave time, and didn't cut well at all.  All of the people I know who use a Norelco love them, and said that in Summer you won't get the razor burn on your neck you get with a screen razor, so I bought the 8894XL.
The shave is good, and when set to the softest setting the heads easily hug your face.  (A firmer setting caused some razor burn, noticeable in hot weather only.)  It's amazingly quite and powerful, shaves quickly, and cleans up easily.  It doesn't shave as close as the Microscreen, nor as well my dad's corded Norelco of 15 years, which he almost never changes blades on.  I have naturally wavy and very thick hair, which it misses occasionally, but is nothing to complain about.  A quick shave only takes 3 minutes; a detailed shave takes 7.  It takes some time to trim around high sideburns accurately and the area under the nose, and is useless for trimming extra eyebrow hair, all of which the screen razor does well.
As far as features go, they're great.  It really does charge in an hour and last 100 minutes.  I let mine go past the 0 minutes left warning the first few charges until the motor slowed regularly while shaving and then recharged it.  (It automatically turns off when the motor can't stay close to normal speed.--recharge before this.)  It lasts about 170 minutes, and the readout gets closer to the actual run time each charge cycle.  Once you set the firmness to what you want it doesn't need to be adjusted again.  The pop-up trimmer could be better, and is kind of like a plastic knife that's hard to cut yourself or anything else with, and doesn't bog the motor.  The clear LED cover scratches amazingly easily, so you'll want to keep the razor in the thin bag when not in use.  The cleaning indicator is accurate, and rinsing under hot water, blowing the water out of the inside, and drying the outside with a towel is quick and easy.  Just keep the trimmer extended until the razor air-dries completely.  I haven't heard any complaints about the battery other than online, so it may be the problem is fixed in the newer razors.
In summary, it's a fun razor that won't wake the family early mornings while giving you a quick shave.  There's no razor burn when the firmness is set correctly, but it also won't shave as close as a blade or screen razor.  There's no guessing on how long the battery will last, which is at least 100 minutes.",Close to Perfect,"['quite', 'back', 'remington', 'microscreen', 'need', 'screen', 'replace', 'dollar', 'cost', 'screen', 'buy', 'norelco', 'bottomend', 'cordless', 'underpowered', 'seem', 'like', 'always', 'end', 'minute', 'shave', 'time', 'nt', 'cut', 'well', 'people', 'know', 'use', 'norelco', 'love', 'say', 'summer', 'wo', 'nt', 'get', 'razor', 'burn', 'neck', 'get', 'screen', 'razor', 'buy', 'xl', 'shave', 'good', 'set', 'soft', 'set', 'head', 'easily', 'hug', 'face', 'firm', 'set', 'cause', 'razor', 'burn', 'noticeable', 'hot', 'weather', 'amazingly', 'quite', 'powerful', 'shaves', 'quickly', 'cleans', 'easily', 'nt', 'shave', 'close', 'microscreen', 'well', 'dad', 'cord', 'norelco', 'year', 'almost', 'never', 'change', 'blade', 'naturally', 'wavy', 'thick', 'hair', 'miss', 'occasionally', 'nothing', 'complain', 'quick', 'shave', 'take', 'minute', 'detail', 'shave', 'take', 'take', 'time', 'trim', 'around', 'high', 'sideburn', 'accurately', 'area', 'nose', 'useless', 'trim', 'extra', 'eyebrow', 'hair', 'screen', 'razor', 'well', 'far', 'feature', 'go', 'great', 'really', 'charge', 'hour', 'last', 'minute', 'let', 'mine', 'go', 'past', 'minute', 'left', 'warning', 'first', 'charge', 'motor', 'slow', 'regularly', 'shaving', 'recharge', 'automatically', 'turn', 'motor', 'ca', 'nt', 'stay', 'close', 'normal', 'speed', 'recharge', 'last', 'minute', 'readout', 'get', 'close', 'actual', 'run', 'time', 'charge', 'cycle', 'set', 'firmness', 'want', 'nt', 'need', 'adjust', 'popup', 'trimmer', 'could', 'well', 'kind', 'like', 'plastic', 'knife', 'hard', 'cut', 'anything', 'else', 'nt', 'bog', 'motor', 'clear', 'lead', 'cover', 'scratch', 'amazingly', 'easily', 'want', 'keep', 'razor', 'thin', 'bag', 'use', 'clean', 'indicator', 'accurate', 'rinse', 'hot', 'water', 'blow', 'water', 'inside', 'drying', 'outside', 'towel', 'quick', 'easy', 'keep', 'trimmer', 'extended', 'razor', 'airdrie', 'completely', 'nt', 'hear', 'complaint', 'battery', 'online', 'may', 'problem', 'fix', 'new', 'razor', 'summary', 'fun', 'razor', 'wo', 'nt', 'wake', 'family', 'early', 'morning', 'give', 'quick', 'shave', 'razor', 'burn', 'firmness', 'set', 'correctly', 'also', 'wo', 'nt', 'shave', 'close', 'blade', 'screen', 'razor', 'guess', 'long', 'battery', 'last', 'least', 'minute']"

5.0,"I had this shaver for about 3 weeks and it was fantastic. It gave me minor irritation due to my more sensitive skin but overall it was nothing much to worry about. Definitely nothing worse than a blade! There is a sensitivity dial on it but when you put it on the most sensitive setting it really limits the shaving performance so I decided to always leave it on Normal.
It gave me a very close shave, about 90% compared to blade but one has to know, electrics are slower in general than blade! If you want a real clean shave you will be spending 9-10 minutes with electric where you can get the same results or maybe better with blade in 4-5 minutes most!
Also, to prevent ingrown hairs a lot of people recommend using aftershave when you are done shaving with your electric.
I did not experience any electrical problems with my unit for the duration of use. On the other hand, the Polymer LED screen looks awesome and very easy to read while saving battery power! The pictures don't really do the screen justice and you have to see it in real.
I've also used my dad's Quadra Action series which is the one right before this one and the replaced ""holes"" & ""slots"" has made a big difference. Also the improved lift&cut system shaves hairs below the skin level more noticeably.
The only reason I returned it was because I wanted to try the CoolSkin (Norelco Advantage) line which has a lotion dispencer and boy, I have to say it was much milder on my skin. Much less irritation and I even tried it with some Edge Shaving Gel and got good resutls! But don't get the 6000 series now cause on May 1st. they are coming out with the Norelco Advantage 7000 series which has the same lift&cut system on this shaver hence I believe a big improvement in shaving quality cause honestly the 6000 Advantage Series didn't really match the 8000 Spectra's closeness but came pretty close. More on par with the 7000 Quadra Action I would say.
Overall I recommend the 8000 Spectra series particularly the 8894XL",Great Shaver!

After Two weeks
---------------
After charging for 4 hours, I tired 8894XL for the first time. I was impressed how quite and close shave it gave me without irritation.  My older Panasonic sounds like a blender compared to this unit. According to Norelco ""Your skin and beard might need a little time to adjust to a new shaving system"". I have very sensitive skin especially area under my nose, chin and neck. Norelco 8894XL gave me the smoothes shave without any irritation the very first day of its use and I don't have to use my Mach3 on my neck to finish the job. On average it takes me 6 to 8 minutes for a single shave which gives me roughly full two weeks of shaving on single charge. With such a long battery life I don't have to carry my adapter for a week long trip. I was always skeptical of Norelco rotary system; 8894XL has really made me a believer and I regret of not giving it a try before. If you are looking for a electric shave that gives you smooth shave with No irritation, do not look else where buy this and you will be impressed. Go ahead and try a Norelco 8894XL  it comes with No Risk! 60-day, Money-back Guarantee.  If you're not fully satisfied with your Norelco 8894XL within 60 days of purchase, all you have to do is return it and Norelco will refund the full purchase price
I noticed few people are complaining about the battery life of this unit. I did not experience that problem at all.

It's definately closer than my last Braun, but that was a lower end model, and it was purchased a long time ago.  I wouldn't throw out the Mach 3, and I still often use the Mach 3 after I shave with an electric for the ultimate shave.  AFter using an electric, the Mach 3 just glides over my face, and the blades seem to last forever, and this way I'm able to get the best of both worlds.  As long as my battery holds out, I'll be happy.  But if the battery starts giving me problems like a lot of other people here report, then I'll be pretty upset, since the shaver was quite expensive.
I guess that I'm amazed that for such an expensive product that they have battery problems and still sell the product.

5.0,"I tried getting a cheap Norelco shaver 6 or 7 years ago. The result was an unusually high amount of razor burn and a fairly poor shave. This was after the ""break in"" period that Norelco recommends, as well. So, I returned to shaving with my Gilette safety razor. Even though it irritated my face, it was still better than the electric shaver.
Finally, I had enough and decided to give an electric shaver one more try. I held nothing back this time and went for the 8894XL, figuring that if it was this expensive, it had to be decent. It looks like my gamble paid off. Thanks to the sensitivity setting, I no longer have to worry about razor burn on my neck. I can set it to a ""Normal"" shave while doing my face and with the flick of my thumb set it to ""Sensitive"" for my neck. It also gives me a shave comparible to that of my old Gilette safety razor.
I've noticed some reviews complaining about their unit not holding a charge. Well, I haven't had too much of a problem with that. Mine holds a large charge fairly well and gives me enough to complete an average-length shave everyday for about two and a half weeks. The manual also recommends that you fully discharge your battery the first time you charge it up (over the few weeks you use it), then charge it fully again. Perhaps this contributed to the failure or degradation of battery power for some people? Just a thought.

The quality is superb and I have had no problems at all with charging.  Indeed, you could probably shave for a month a single charge.  Went on vacation recently and didn't bother bringing the charger.
The build quality is excellent and the unit is water resistent.  It's easy to flip open the head and run it under the faucet.  As mentioned in some of the other reviews, the little stand it comes with is disappointing.  The razer will stand on it, but it is a little precarious and easily falls over.

If you aren't perfectly aligned, you shave nothing.  A rotary shaver like the Norelco is much more forgiving in this regard.  Even if you are slightly crossing the grain, the Norelco will still pick-up and shave your beard.  Ultimately, the Panasonic gives a closer shave if you spend the time to get it done right.
2.  The Pansonic is less irritating to my skin.  Your mileage may vary.
3.  The Pansonic has an inductive charger, which means you can just put the shaver into the stand, and it charges.  The Norelco requires that you take the unit out of the stand and manually plug it into the charger.
4.  This Norelco provides much more information.  It tells you
exactly how many minutes you spent shaving, how many minutes are left on the battery, when to clean the razor, and when to change the heads.  The Panasonic merely gives you a LED showing the percentage of battery life remaining (i.e., 80%, 60%, etc).
5.  You should know that Norelco is owned by Philips.  If you read my other reviews, you will find that I have little love for Philips, its customer service, and its products.  On the other hand, I have a great deal of respect for Panasonic.
6.  Although Philips says that you should use the razor dry, it does work for wet shaving in the shower, and if you haven't tried it, you should at least once.  Just buy some shaving gel or creme and give it a try.  Clean the razor in the shower when you're done by running it through the water.
All in all, the jury is still out.  I like both razors and haven't decided which one that I like best.

3.0,"Follow up 7 WEEKS - OK, I like it better than at first. The trick listed later about running for two hours with the heads open to run the battery down, then full recharge seems to have worked. No further problems with battery, charge or life. Heads are still very, very nice. The washout feature is the best part of the whole deal. Excellent and comfortable shave, but very expensive and should have been better.
FOLLOW-UP: 1 WEEK
My mistake - I guess the battery IS L-ion instead of Ni-Cd. Don't know where I thought I got the bad info. Oh well. Still, the point is even MORE important in that case; this system seems to be buggy. Surely somebody at Philips knows enough about battery tech to have helped the shaver division do better than this! If not, should have got a bit of help from Nokia. Out of all the cameras, camcorders, cell phones, Palms, computers etc. that I use that have L-ion batteries, this is the ""shakiest."" I'll post again to follow up on the ""conditioning"" cycle I tried. So far it seems to be working better.
FIRST REVIEW
I have used various Norelco rechargable triple header shavers for the last 30+ years. I have been impressed that each model I purchased has been an improvement over the previous one. Well, maybe that isn't the case this time. My last shaver was a 5885 XL that I have used more than three years. It was getting pretty ""tired"" and I was looking forward to an upgrade. Hmmm.
THE GOOD NEWS
SHAVING EXPERIENCE - this is the best shaving machine of any type I have every used. I can shave as close as diligent effort with a good blade razor. I think the little holes in the head along with the familiar slots make a big difference. You have to go slowly to get really close, but it is comfortable and does a great job. Top notch performance from the head system.
CLEANING- the ability to clean the razor under the faucet is a big plus. I open the head and rinse under hot tap water after every use, then leave the head open and let it air dry. I disassembled the heads once for more thorough cleaning. I expect once a month would be plenty often for this since you can do a quick, easy clean every day. This really is a nice feature, and I suspect it keeps the cutters working better, too.
NOT MADE IN CHINA!
THE BAD NEWS:
BATTERY!
I charged overnignt before first use. First few charges, I only got about 20 minutes shaving before the machine shut down. When applying a little extra cutting pressure, the shaver would unexpectedly stop, and the ""minutes left"" readout would go to zero. This happened several times. Plugging in may or may not get you any more shaving. Last time it did this, I recharged fully, then with the head open, let the motor run for about 2 hours until the battery was fairly well (I assume) discharged. Then, I fully recharged it. I hope this ""conditions"" the NiCd battery. So far it seems to be working better. Still, this is pretty sad for a shaver in this price range. For the money  Norelco gets for this thing, it should have intelligent L-ion battery technology in it!
HANDLE ERGONOMICS
Not bad, but a step backwards from the 5885.
FANCY DISPLAY?
Who sold who a bill of goods on this deal? There is no more information than on pevious models; it is in a less usable format (minutes remaining instead of shaves remaining) and you have TO TURN THE SHAVER ON to see the current charge status. The stupid display is blank until you run the shaver. On previous LCD models, you could ALWAYS read the display. If Norelco REALLLY REALLY thinks they need to use this LED display, at least put a button on the shaver to turn on the display without having to run the shaver! This is dimbulb design of the first order.
CHARGING
Past models didn't need a ""wall wart"" charger. They directly plugged into a range of voltages etc. without any kind of wall transformer/power converter dealie. This was nice since all older Norelco cords worked and they were not special. The new ""James Bond"" shaver is a big step backwards since it now has a ""wall wart."" I expect there is actually a good reason for this; the wash out under the faucet feature probably requires low voltage to the shaver head rather than line voltage. If that is the case, it is worth the trade off, I guess. Still, the older system was more convenient.
SUMMARY/RECOMMENDATION:
Shaving heads are great. The rest of the machine is not Norelco's best effort. Buy the cheapest shaver that incorporates the Norelco SPECTRA heads and save your money on the ""100"" minute batteries and the lame readout.","GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS","['follow', 'week', 'ok', 'like', 'well', 'first', 'trick', 'list', 'later', 'run', 'two', 'hour', 'head', 'open', 'run', 'battery', 'full', 'recharge', 'seem', 'work', 'problem', 'battery', 'charge', 'life', 'head', 'still', 'nice', 'washout', 'feature', 'good', 'part', 'whole', 'deal', 'excellent', 'comfortable', 'shave', 'expensive', 'well', 'followup', 'week', 'mistake', 'guess', 'battery', 'lion', 'instead', 'nicd', 'nt', 'know', 'think', 'get', 'bad', 'info', 'oh', 'well', 'still', 'point', 'even', 'important', 'case', 'system', 'seem', 'buggy', 'surely', 'somebody', 'philips', 'know', 'enough', 'battery', 'tech', 'help', 'shaver', 'division', 'well', 'get', 'bit', 'help', 'nokia', 'cameras', 'camcorder', 'cell', 'phone', 'palms', 'computer', 'etc', 'use', 'lion', 'battery', 'shakiest', 'post', 'follow', 'conditioning', 'cycle', 'try', 'far', 'seem', 'work', 'well', 'first', 'review', 'use', 'various', 'norelco', 'rechargable', 'triple', 'header', 'shaver', 'last', 'year', 'impress', 'model', 'purchase', 'improvement', 'previous', 'one', 'well', 'maybe', 'nt', 'case', 'time', 'last', 'shaver', 'xl', 'use', 'three', 'year', 'get', 'pretty', 'tired', 'look', 'forward', 'upgrade', 'hmmm', 'good', 'news', 'shaving', 'experience', 'good', 'shaving', 'machine', 'type', 'every', 'use', 'shave', 'close', 'diligent', 'effort', 'good', 'blade', 'razor', 'think', 'little', 'hole', 'head', 'along', 'familiar', 'slot', 'make', 'big', 'difference', 'go', 'slowly', 'get', 'really', 'close', 'comfortable', 'great', 'job', 'top', 'notch', 'performance', 'head', 'system', 'clean', 'ability', 'clean', 'razor', 'faucet', 'big', 'plus', 'open', 'head', 'rinse', 'hot', 'tap', 'water', 'every', 'use', 'leave', 'head', 'open', 'let', 'air', 'dry', 'disassemble', 'head', 'thorough', 'clean', 'expect', 'month', 'would', 'plenty', 'often', 'since', 'quick', 'easy', 'clean', 'every', 'day', 'really', 'nice', 'feature', 'suspect', 'keep', 'cutter', 'work', 'well', 'make', 'china', 'bad', 'news', 'battery', 'charge', 'overnignt', 'first', 'use', 'first', 'charge', 'get', 'minute', 'shaving', 'machine', 'shut', 'apply', 'little', 'extra', 'cut', 'pressure', 'shaver', 'would', 'unexpectedly', 'stop', 'minute', 'left', 'readout', 'would', 'go', 'zero', 'happen', 'several', 'time', 'plug', 'may', 'may', 'get', 'shaving', 'last', 'time', 'recharge', 'fully', 'head', 'open', 'let', 'motor', 'run', 'hour', 'battery', 'fairly', 'well', 'assume', 'discharged', 'fully', 'recharge', 'hope', 'condition', 'nicd', 'battery', 'far', 'seem', 'work', 'well', 'still', 'pretty', 'sad', 'shaver', 'price', 'range', 'money', 'norelco', 'get', 'thing', 'intelligent', 'lion', 'battery', 'technology', 'handle', 'ergonomic', 'bad', 'step', 'backwards', 'fancy', 'display', 'sell', 'bill', 'good', 'deal', 'information', 'pevious', 'model', 'less', 'usable', 'format', 'minute', 'remain', 'instead', 'shaves', 'remain', 'turn', 'shaver', 'see', 'current', 'charge', 'status', 'stupid', 'display', 'blank', 'run', 'shaver', 'previous', 'lcd', 'model', 'could', 'always', 'read', 'display', 'norelco', 'reallly', 'really', 'think', 'need', 'use', 'lead', 'display', 'least', 'put', 'button', 'shaver', 'turn', 'display', 'without', 'run', 'shaver', 'dimbulb', 'design', 'first', 'order', 'charge', 'past', 'model', 'nt', 'need', 'wall', 'wart', 'charger', 'directly', 'plug', 'range', 'voltage', 'etc', 'without', 'kind', 'wall', 'transformerpower', 'converter', 'dealie', 'nice', 'since', 'old', 'norelco', 'cord', 'work', 'special', 'new', 'james', 'bond', 'shaver', 'big', 'step', 'backwards', 'since', 'wall', 'wart', 'expect', 'actually', 'good', 'reason', 'wash', 'faucet', 'feature', 'probably', 'require', 'low', 'voltage', 'shaver', 'head', 'rather', 'line', 'voltage', 'case', 'worth', 'trade', 'guess', 'still', 'old', 'system', 'convenient', 'summaryrecommendation', 'shaving', 'head', 'great', 'rest', 'machine', 'norelco', 'good', 'effort', 'buy', 'cheap', 'shaver', 'incorporates', 'norelco', 'spectra', 'head', 'save', 'money', 'minute', 'battery', 'lame', 'readout']"
2.0,"Dear Mr. Bond,
After trying your new secret shaving weapon, by the name of ""Norelco 8894XL Spectra"", let me report about my short experience with it. First of all, I wonder about the name ""Spectra"". All your fans know, that Roger Moore got rid of Spectra and its vicious leader, Mr. Bluefeld, about 30 years ago. So how come we meet it again today as one of your gadgets? I know. You'll say it's nothing, and you'll probably be right. But the name is a symbol to my main argue, that 8894 is nothing but an old machine pretending to be new.
It's a good shaver, but it doesn't give you the right value for price. I have a 10 yrs. old Norelco 5584XL, that offers more or less the same digital functions of 8894's LCD, and does a good work on my face. Of course,  the 8894XL's battery is better, and gives about 30 minutes more of shaving, before recharging it, the designing is more up to date,and you can wash it with water, unlike the older generations. But the 5584XL, looks nice and elegant even today, it's most reliable, and works almost as new. The problem, 007, was, that I tried the 8894XL for few days and did not feel much improvement comparing to the 5584, that can justify spending so much money on it.
 I don't know Braun or Remington last models, but in my opinion, if 8894 is Philips/Norelco's best shot, their shaving machine division has reached its moment of truth.
So, Mr. Bond, these are the reasons for not buying your shaving weapon: it looks new, it costs new, but it doesn't work as new.
P.S. If you think about selling your old silver Aston Martin by the price of your shaving machine, please let me know.",The moment of truth of Philips/Norelco,"['dear', 'mr', 'bond', 'try', 'new', 'secret', 'shaving', 'weapon', 'name', 'norelco', 'xl', 'spectra', 'let', 'report', 'short', 'experience', 'first', 'wonder', 'name', 'spectra', 'fan', 'know', 'roger', 'moore', 'get', 'rid', 'spectra', 'vicious', 'leader', 'mr', 'bluefeld', 'year', 'ago', 'come', 'meet', 'today', 'one', 'gadgets', 'know', 'say', 'nothing', 'probably', 'right', 'name', 'symbol', 'main', 'argue', 'nothing', 'old', 'machine', 'pretend', 'new', 'good', 'shaver', 'nt', 'give', 'right', 'value', 'price', 'yrs', 'old', 'norelco', 'xl', 'offer', 'less', 'digital', 'function', 'lcd', 'good', 'work', 'face', 'course', 'xl', 'battery', 'well', 'give', 'minute', 'shaving', 'recharge', 'design', 'date', 'wash', 'water', 'unlike', 'old', 'generation', 'xl', 'look', 'nice', 'elegant', 'even', 'today', 'reliable', 'work', 'almost', 'new', 'problem', 'try', 'xl', 'day', 'feel', 'much', 'improvement', 'compare', 'justify', 'spending', 'much', 'money', 'nt', 'know', 'braun', 'remington', 'last', 'model', 'opinion', 'philipsnorelco', 'good', 'shoot', 'shaving', 'machine', 'division', 'reach', 'moment', 'truth', 'mr', 'bond', 'reason', 'buy', 'shaving', 'weapon', 'look', 'new', 'cost', 'new', 'nt', 'work', 'new', 'ps', 'think', 'sell', 'old', 'silver', 'aston', 'martin', 'price', 'shaving', 'machine', 'please', 'let', 'know']"
3.0,"I have fairly sensitive skin and have tried a variety of methods to shaving, none of which have been satisfactory.  Among the multi-blade razors, I found the Schick Quattro to be the best.  In combination with a fine shaving brush and soap, it worked pretty well.  But it was too time consuming, and rather messy.  For years, I'd been a Braun electric razor user and had been using the Braun Syncro for the past 2 years.  But it was rather rough on my face, even after replacing the blades, loud, and cumbersome to clean.  Then I discovered the Norelco Spectra line, which seemingly had all the features I'd been looking for.  I'll just sum up what features mattered to me and how I rate them.
1. Shaving Closeness: Good
Norelco recommends 3 weeks of exclusive use for your face the adjust to the shave.  I'd been testing out an older Norelco Quadra razor I had, so though I only used the Spectra for a week, I think my face was adjusted fine.  It did a fairly decent job, though I still had to stretch my chin area to get the closest shave.  But for the upper lip area, I still can't figure out how to get it to shave as close as a foil shaver, like the Braun.
2. Comfort: Very Good
My old Norelco Quadra used to literally pull the hair and it would hurt!  The Braun was abrasive and I'd often need to put on some lotion afterwards.  But I thought the Spectra was very comfortable and did not irritate my sensitive skin.  However, I could not tell much of a difference in the 7 ""Comfort"" settings, even when I went from the highest to the lowest setting in comparing this feature.
3. Ease of Cleaning: Excellent
Does it get any better than just rinsing the heads with water?  The Braun system of cleaning is just plain inefficient and costly.  Why keep a hideous cleaning stand around and pay for the cleaning solution, when you can just rinse with water?
4. Display:  Excellent
Once you get past the wow factor of how nice the polymer LED looks, it's not much more than just a simple indicator of how long your battery will last.  The other indicators I don't find as useful, though some might.
5. Noise: Excellent
Compared to the Braun, it's like shaving in stealth mode.  I never realized that electric razors didn't all sound like gas lawn mowers.
6. Battery Life: Undeterminable
The major reason I decided to get ""James Bond's Shaver Of Choice"" over the less expensive model just below it, was that the 8894XL has 100 minute shaving time, as opposed to the 70 minute shaving time of the 8890XL.  As it turns out, the unit I received is defective.  I charged it as the manual suggests and after 4-5 charging cycles, I couldn't get the razor to operate for more than 6 minutes before dying.
My choice for electric razors is Norelco, easily.  But I don't plan to replace my defective unit with another 8894XL.  I don't find the differences between it and the 8890XL to be enough to justify the cost difference (only thirdy dolores on Amazon actually).  But considering my 8894XL had charging issues, I don't feel like going through another return, if I get another defective one.  As soon as I receive my credit, I will probably order the 8890XL.","Defective, but shaved fairly well","['fairly', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'try', 'variety', 'method', 'shaving', 'none', 'satisfactory', 'among', 'multiblade', 'razor', 'find', 'schick', 'quattro', 'good', 'combination', 'fine', 'shaving', 'brush', 'soap', 'work', 'pretty', 'well', 'time', 'consume', 'rather', 'messy', 'year', 'braun', 'electric', 'razor', 'user', 'use', 'braun', 'syncro', 'past', 'year', 'rather', 'rough', 'face', 'even', 'replace', 'blade', 'loud', 'cumbersome', 'clean', 'discover', 'norelco', 'spectra', 'line', 'seemingly', 'feature', 'look', 'sum', 'feature', 'matter', 'rate', 'shaving', 'closeness', 'good', 'norelco', 'mend', 'week', 'exclusive', 'use', 'face', 'adjust', 'shave', 'testing', 'old', 'norelco', 'quadra', 'razor', 'though', 'use', 'spectra', 'week', 'think', 'face', 'adjust', 'fine', 'fairly', 'decent', 'job', 'though', 'still', 'stretch', 'chin', 'area', 'get', 'close', 'shave', 'upper', 'lip', 'area', 'still', 'ca', 'nt', 'figure', 'get', 'shave', 'close', 'foil', 'shaver', 'like', 'braun', 'comfort', 'good', 'old', 'norelco', 'quadra', 'use', 'literally', 'pull', 'hair', 'would', 'hurt', 'braun', 'abrasive', 'often', 'need', 'put', 'lotion', 'afterwards', 'think', 'spectra', 'comfortable', 'irritate', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'however', 'could', 'tell', 'much', 'difference', 'comfort', 'setting', 'even', 'go', 'high', 'low', 'set', 'compare', 'feature', 'ease', 'clean', 'excellent', 'get', 'well', 'rinse', 'head', 'water', 'braun', 'system', 'clean', 'plain', 'inefficient', 'costly', 'keep', 'hideous', 'clean', 'stand', 'around', 'pay', 'clean', 'solution', 'rinse', 'water', 'display', 'excellent', 'get', 'past', 'wow', 'factor', 'nice', 'polymer', 'lead', 'look', 'much', 'simple', 'indicator', 'long', 'battery', 'last', 'indicator', 'nt', 'find', 'useful', 'though', 'may', 'noise', 'excellent', 'compare', 'braun', 'like', 'shaving', 'stealth', 'mode', 'never', 'realize', 'electric', 'razor', 'nt', 'sound', 'like', 'gas', 'lawn', 'mower', 'battery', 'life', 'undeterminable', 'major', 'reason', 'decide', 'get', 'james', 'bond', 'shaver', 'choice', 'less', 'expensive', 'model', 'xl', 'minute', 'shaving', 'time', 'oppose', 'minute', 'shaving', 'time', 'xl', 'turn', 'unit', 'receive', 'defective', 'charge', 'manual', 'suggest', 'charge', 'cycle', 'could', 'nt', 'get', 'razor', 'operate', 'minute', 'die', 'choice', 'electric', 'razor', 'norelco', 'easily', 'nt', 'plan', 'replace', 'defective', 'unit', 'another', 'xl', 'nt', 'find', 'difference', 'xl', 'enough', 'justify', 'cost', 'difference', 'thirdy', 'dolore', 'amazon', 'actually', 'consider', 'xl', 'charge', 'issue', 'nt', 'feel', 'like', 'go', 'another', 'return', 'get', 'another', 'defective', 'one', 'soon', 'receive', 'credit', 'probably', 'order', 'xl']"

5.0,"Well, after having my last Norelco stolen from my luggage on a return trip from South America, I was looking for something to replace it.  I've always had sensitive skin and my Dad had been using a Norelco model that was good but not adjustable (a dermatologist recommended that I use a razor that could be adjusted).
That made sense to me.
So, with it on sale and all the other offers, I bought it.  Undoutedly, the most expensive razor I have ever purchased.
Now several months have passed and I can say that I love it.  With the dial on the 'sensitive' setting (all the way to the S), it does a fine job in terms of shaving close, but leaves no razor burn.  It is comfortable to hold.  Only very rarely does it pull a hair.  It can handle several days of stubble without complaint.
And the battery?  Shaving several times a week I can go an entire month without recharging.
The sideburn trimmer is well made but it is just that, a trimmer.  Don't expect it to shave your head.
The ability to rinse the heads under water is great.  Easy cleaning!

5.0,"I've got a multi-ethnic background, which translates into my facial hairs grow in different directions making several opposing grains to work with, and meaning that bladed razors cause no end of ingrown hairs.  My beard is also very heavy, and the hairs are very tough.  On top of that, I have incredibly sensitive skin, to the degree that cheaper electric razors have caused me to bleed.  On the occasions that I've been shaved by a professional barber, I ended up bleeding.  That being said, it's incredibly hard for me to shave with any sort of razor without damaging my skin.  I've had several other electric razors, including a high end Braun and the best one Remington made, which isn't saying much.  This razor is by far the best with which I've ever had the chance to shave.  The worst thing that I can say is that it leaves my skin somewhat dry after a few shaves, but that means that I should moisturize more.  Being someone who has lived for many years at a time with a full beard, fashionable or not, because the alternative wasn't very promising, this Norelco is amazing.
I work in a high-end sales position, dealing with corporate executives, and even with my heavy, fast growing beard, using the sensitive setting on this razor, I get enough of a shave to look good for my client visits.  What the other reviewers have said here, in that you have to work with it for a few weeks for your beard to get adjusted to it, does seem to be true.  It comes with a 3 week money back guarantee, which means, to me, that there's nothing to lose.

1.0,"I shuddered after reading the glowing reviews of this overpriced razor. A new razor is like a new car...what man doesn't love it? The real test comes years later, when problems occur. As a Norelco user most of my life, I sprung for this gimmick. The initial shaves were incredible, but I remained skeptical. After the initial 2 1/2 hour charge, it ran and ran. In fact, the LED readout was inaccurate, as it merrily hummed away, long after it displayed zero minutes available. The nine setting dial is a true joke. What were they thinking here? Some intricate scientific approach to shaving? Any man just wants the closest shave possible, so I dialed it up to the max. After usage when the blades wear, every man will end up doing this anyway. Like any electric razor, it is only as good as the blades. The LED gimmicks on this soon grew old. I just wanted it to fire up and annihilate my whiskers. After two charges, the shaves got worse and I had to finish with a disposable razor to scrape away the missed stubble. The replacement blades are overpriced to coordinate with this ""exclusive James Bond"" razor. Norelco is laughing it's way to the bank, as men buy into this gimmick.

2.0,"Ok, it's a nice razor and does shave close.  But no closer (in fact a little less close ) than a Braun foil razor I've had for 4 years, which I bought reconditioned.
Caveat:  I use the electric razor to shave my head.  When I did half my head with the Norelco and 1/2 with the Braun, the Braun was closer-even if barely.  The Norelco was on it's closest setting, too. Also, the Norelco's blades were brand new, and my Braun's were about 6 months old!  This was most noticeable at the end of the day, when the Braun stubble was a little shorter.  Also, when I used the Norelco on my face and the back of my neck, it gave me razor burn like I have never experinced with a foil razor.
As another reviewer here said, change your foil and blades (for me about once every year or so) and that's the real key to good performance. Finally, it just makes sense to me that the thinner the metal between the balde and your face, the closer the shave.

5.0,"I started my electric shaving experience with a Norelco. It was admittedly awful though somewhat less painful than the blade! I moved to a foil shaver (Braun) for about 10 years (two shavers) and recently had the opportunity for a full-featured upgrade. I was able to try the new Brauns at a local shaver store and was impressed and then tried the Spectra model. I was FLOORED. This is an excellent shaver. Battery life is unreal (I get about four-six weeks -- can't estimate well yet as I have only charged it ONCE after initial charge!), cleans in water, shaves quickly (and well), and very quiet. Yes, there is hype and gimmicry on this model (but the color, display, and battery are great!) and you may do just as well with a [less expensive] Spectra (or Quadra), but this is a great system. It looks and works really really great! :)
UPDATE (11/13/03): I am nearing a year of use on this shaver and nothing has changed. This is a great product. THe battery life I initially reported is amazing still.

4.0,"I have been using this razor for a couple of weeks, have loged about 87 minutes and it is going strong. There is little doubt that it will romp through 100 minutes in style. It is pretty much what I had been led to expect.
SPEED--The only thing slower than an old Norelco is 'stop'. The speed was significantly improved by the newer line, specifically the 5821XL. The Spectra is even faster, however psychologically, it seems like it could be lumbering along. Perhaps this is due to the razor being very quiet. It just seems a bit slower than my Grundig Avantgarde, but it isn't. Actually, it seems to get the job done about as quickly as my Panasonic Wet-Dry, which is faster than the wind.
CLOSENESS--It gives the illusion of not delivering a shave closer than the Grundig, but it does. In fact, my neck began feeling sensitive immediately due to the closeness (head pressure) of the shave. I completely acclimated after a week and this no longer is a problem. I probably should have put the razor on a more gentle setting but I just set it to N (normal...for the closest shave)and went about business. There is a 9 position setting that seems a bit over-hyped to me. I assume there are subtle differences, but after a short time, you will settle upon a setting and go from there. The wheel that sets this is almost impossible to read without a magnifying glass is not the most user-friendly thing I have seen, but in the long run is no big deal.
ERGONOMIC FEEL OF RAZOR--Excellent. The thumb naturally falls directly over the recessed electronic on-off switch.
DISPLAYS--Gives you elapsed time display of current minutes used as well as an overall display of remaining minutes is a very easy to read format. Occasionally a visual logo of a fosset appears that indicates when you should clean your razor under running water. This feature, called an 'Automatic Cleaning Indicator' seems to be hap-hazzard at best. There does not seem to be any correlation between amount of debris contained within the hair chamber and the display. Actually, just open the hair chamber (quick release button at the base of the head complex flips up the assembly) and give a quick blow after each shave and all returns to squeeky clean without having to resort to the Chineese water torture for the quick rinse off. Can't shave in wet, but cleaning is much quicker and easier to accomplish than for any other shaver I have owned, save for the Panasonic W/D.
PROTECTIVE COVER--Plastic, as per the industry. At best, they tend to .... This is not much better. Oh, it doesn't fall off all the time as does the Remmington Interceptor, but needs to be placed in a certain manner. There are 3 grippers on the cover. The slightly widest one goes to the back...that is, if you want a reasonable fit. I overcame this by puting a red mark on the obease one. Head covers are a big deal to me. That is what I like about the rather over-priced Grundig (built in and rolls into position).
TRIMMER--What can I say? It is a Norelco. You shave near your sideburns at your own risk. The good news however, is that the built in trimmer seems to get the job done better than most. The downside is that with other more conventional razors, we tend to do most of the dirty work during the shave proper, thus relegating the built in trimmer (worthless on so many makes) to a lesser usage.
RELIABILITY--Can't say after only a few weeks. Quien Sabe?, but if it is similar to other Norelco's, and I don't see why not, it should be very good. Certainly much better than the Panasonic line (especially lLinears)that sometimes die unpredictably. Once down for the count, they can't be repaired. If not under warranty, one is dead meat. The Spectra has a 2 year warranty coupled with a 60 day money-back guarantee (whatever that means...shipment costs, delays, etc.).
BOTTOM LINE--It seems well worth the money. I didn't give it a '5' because I don't view any razor as being worthy. I am still looking for my absolute favorite, the Eltron Universal to return to the market. Not as fast as some...a lousy trimmer, but man is it good to your face (provided you use the gold foil which has not been produced for many years). Not to be confused with the newer Eltrons, which are not even better (at least to me) than a Braun.
Addenda: It is now slightly over 1 month of usage. All is exactly as I found it initially. I have drained down to zero on the display on two separate occasions. Suggest you do that in order to properly condition the batteries. A full charge for me is aprox. 103 minutes. The shave is perhaps the most gentle of all my electric razors.

I am a 20 year user of upper-end disposables (Mach 3, since it came out) and my wife decided it was time for me to ditch the expense and time of the lather and water. I have tried many electrics: Braun, Panasonic even Norelco but the Spectra 8894XL tops them all. Make sure you give your face time to adjust. Most people expect an electric to shave as close as a true razor...give it 2 weeks and you will be pleased with the results.
As for the razor itself:
Pros
1. The Comfort Control System is for real...I develop ingrown hairs, but the Spectra has eliminated 99% of this problem.
2. You will love the informative display: IF you are a techno junkie like me...if not, go with the 8825XL; same razor, minus the Lithium battery and Display.
3. Low noise...your wife will love this one. I can talk on my cell phone and shave...While driving! (don't try it!)
4. Rinse with water! 'nuff said
5. Leather Case...a touch of class from Phillips on this one.
6. 60 day money-back guarantee!
Cons
1. The pop-up trimmer feels cheap and is difficult to use.
2. The Plastic Head-Cover and Stand are useless...and feel cheap.
3. Expensive, and I'm tight!...BUT it is worth the money...
4. The blue power cord does NOT match the razor...(trivial, but true!)

3.0,"I bought an expensive Norelco ""Spectra"" about eight weeks ago. I don't find it better than my last new and expensive Norelco, a ""Quad Action,"" or whatever last year's ""Razor-du-Jour"" from Norelco was called, and I'm really disappointed.  Each year the Norelco offers less and less value.  (Ratio of quality to price.) It is not as close, and it takes longer to shave.  The only difference I can see is the little adjustment wheel, which they've had before in different forms, the pretty pearlized colors, and the the holes versus slots moved to a different location on the perimeter of each of the three circular heads. The holes are much closer shaving, as they have always been on foil razors. Norelco claims that the slots are better for ""longer hairs,"" but if you shave every day, why would you have ""longer hairs"" on your face? The bottom line is that this model is NOT faster or closer than the previous one, although it's a bit smoother, but it IS more expensive. I keep buying these in the hope that each successive one is actually an improvement, rather than a marketing device with marginal changes. (And the ""James Bond"" tie-in promotional gift is simply, well, juvenile.  Anyone old enough to shave can see this is useless and unrelated.  A small package of pre-shave, a shaving stick, or cleaning/soaking fluid would make more sense.)  But the truth of the matter in my experience is that any of the past three major models (""Spectra,"" ""Quad,"" ""Reflex,"" whatever) are comparable if you use an appropriate pre-shave, clean the shaver often, and replace the heads as needed.  (The ability to rinse the razor clean WAS significant, however.)  The closest Norelco was the one with the micro-thin indentation in the center of each circular head around the perimeter. The fastest one had 36 (I think) cutting blades, instead of the reduced number now. (When I asked Norelco why they cut the number of blades, they said it had something to do with the ""hair reservoir."" What happened to the hair before?) I will continue to use Norelco, and I own three of them.  I have used them for 48 years, and they're still the best rotary razor.  But I wish they would wait for REAL improvements before releasing a new razor.

5.0,"I was acutally hired to test this along with two other rotary models and 5 other electric straight edges (remington-like) in a recent product test. All of us in the test group came back with the overwhelming nod toward the Spectra in every category -- comfort, closeness and easy of use.
I've personally used a Norelco (the low end model) for a few years. Good but not great. This is a completely different animal with better cutting design for both better closeness on the face and more comfort on the neck and other angles. After a week of testing I really didn't want to return it.
The 'extra' features didn't matter much to me when I started, but my opinion quickly changed. Have a 'minutes remaining' to recharge was very useful when travelling. I knew whether I needed to bring the cord or not. That it is water resistant meant a little less worry when working near the wet sink. (I've also had this strange anxiety about it accidentally kerplunking into the toilet...now that fear is gone.)
There are not too many devices I use everyday, and that's how I'd justify the price. My cheaper norelco has been with me for about 5 years and I expect at least the same for this guy, so it can be amortized to about 10 cents a day.

I'm completely convinced that the Norelco rotary floating head system is far superior then the linear blade foil systems found on other razors like the Panasonic and Braun.  I've owned them all.

You can also get a circular rhythm with the rotary that you can't get with the linear. Some people complain there is less control with the Norelco, especially around the side burns.  This is true, but I've found that once you get used to navigating the Norelco it becomes second nature.
One thing that threw me off before the purchase was a complaint I read about this razor having slots and holes on the foils heads.  More specifically, the complaint was that it took a longer time to shave with the Spectra then it does with the Reflex action and Advantage.  I can't comment on the Reflex action but I can comment on the Advantage as I own one.  There is some truth to this!  The difference is the Advantage has many more slots and more blades as compared to the Spectra. The Spectra has 9 blades per head for a total of 27 for the three heads.  The claim is that this gives it a more open structure and allows for a sharper blade angle that lifts whiskers sooner and higher for a closer shave. The Advantage on the other hand has 15 blades per head for a total of  45 blades.  That equates to more coverage - 60% to be exact.  This combined with the fact the Advantage foil has all slots explains why you can plow through more whiskers in less time.  However, this notwithstanding, the spectra may take a little longer to shave but the configuration gives a much closer shave.  The stubble slots also do tend to take care of the shorter whiskers by catching them and allowing the blades to cut them.
Now a word on battery life and the LED; the battery life of 100 minutes is amazing, I've only had to charge the razor twice since I owned it.  I'm a proponent of conditioning the battery by using the charge up until you really need to charge it.  The LED is very cool as there is no more guessing about charge left and time used.
The nine settings on the Personal Comfort level setting is a nice touch, but I've been using the razor on the normal setting with great results.  At first I did set it back a few notches which led to less irritation at first, but now that my face is used to it the N setting works well without irritation.
One other thing I've found that really improves the shave. Williams Lectric Shave Utlra Pre-Shave ""GEL"".  This is non-greasy and much better then their oil based formula.

* *Very* quiet
* the display showing minutes of battery life remaining is helpful
* an icon appears if the unit needs cleaning
* good return policy
However:
* Not a close shave - not remotely.
* Despite the above, makes mincemeat (it drew blood!) of my neck.  It's very painful and the big red welts it leaves look terrible.
* The much-vaunted sensitivity adjustment just adjusts the distance between the cutters and the surface of the shave head.  And even at max sensitivity it still butchered my neck.
* Takes forever - I have a full beard so all I have to shave is the hollows of my cheeks and my neck.  Just that takes more than three minutes!

4.0,"It's true what other reviewers have said: you'll get the best results out of the 7865XL (and the others in the 7800 series) if you wash and dry your face first.  Then it glides smoothly and works in very few passes.  I probably have to make sure I cross each area about three times in different directions (mostly going against the grain of the whiskers) to get everything.  If I follow those two basic guidelines, my chin is smooth as can be and the shave lasts all day.  If I don't wash first it's still a joy to use, but it takes longer (more passes in different directions to get every whisker) and won't last all day (more like 8 hours).

This item is worth buying, it's fun to use... I'd give it 4 and a half stars.  To get 5 it would need to do everything in a single pass, and that's a tall order.

The booklet says to use only the electric shaver for 3 weeks straight to give your skin time to adjust; but not only wouldn't this thing shave my neck decently, it actually caused a nasty rash to develop as well.

4.0,"This Norelco (actually made by Philips) one was bought to replace an older shaver (I've used Norelco, Philips and Panasonics over the years.) This one is more efficient (faster, better shave) than my older one, and an amazingly amount quieter. What do you know- this time, ""new and improved"" really is accurate!
What I like: the shaver fits the hand well, the pivoting blade heads fit the face and as a result shave quite well. The battery strength indicator, consisting of bright LEDs showing the percentage of charge remaining in 20% increments, is very useful, and the flip-up hinged shaver head section is easy to clean with warm water (I still have to consciously force myself to do this!) They have also ""shrunk"" the half-egg shaped power transformer, and you can use 100 - 220 volts to plug / charge, a good thing for someone who travels globally as I do.
What I don't like: the pop-up trimmer is only fair - it works, but it's actually not as effective as the one on my old shaver! The deep well holding the head rotors shafts is not so easy to clean with a brush, particularly with the hinged head; they are still using a non-user replaceable NiCd battery; the gimmicky cutter head plate section with holes seems merely that - gimmicky, not useful for any real shaving.
Tips: After cleaning the head / blade assemblies, allow them to dry fully and spray-lubricate with something like ""Shaver Saver."" When power seems low, turn the shaver on and allow to discharge fully before reccharging - these are, after all, still NiCd batteries with the ""memory"" effect. These tips have allowed my previous electrics' battery - and cutter head assemblies - to last a long time (I have a heavy beard - even with a blade shaver, I have to shave again in the afternoon if I have a dinner appointment.)
Recommendation: This is a very good, easy to use, quick and quiet electric shaver - the best I have ever used. It packs easily for travel, and though it is a bit finnicky to clean, I like it because it does the job I need it to do.

5.0,"I got this razor for my husband for his birthday.  He had a Norelco 4845 (I think) for the last 5 years so I know that the products were long lasting.  I was looking to buy new blades but they were hard to find so I figured I'd just buy a new razor.
Reasons I went with this one--quick charge time (only an hour), the super quick charge in a hurry (enough to jump into a shower while charging, and then quick shave), the charge % indicator, and able to wash the heads under water.  All of these were an upgrade from my husband's old razor.  In the last 4 months, he has only needed to charge it twice (and he shaves about twice a day, before work and if we go out in the evening--he grows his hair fast, so please don't think it is because the razor isn't doing it's job...he's just like that).  He can rinse the heads under water, eliminating the hair around the trashcan when he misses.  The charge % indicator and the quick charge is great so he doesn't waken up in the morning and realize he can't shave because it isn't charged.  I also think the razor is cutting the hair better (and I know a wife can tell) than his old one.
Reasons for not getting a higher up model--Well, the price was one issue.  I spent around $99 at Target for this model.  The next highest in the series has an LCD charge % indicator, and I didn't feel it was necessary (and just one more electronic component to deal with).  The 8 series looked cool, but comparing the one that was the same price, this one had more features.  And it looked like the only difference with the heads was that the spacer for short and longer hairs were alternating rather than two separate areas.

5.0,"I have been using Norelco rotary shavers for the last 20 years. The last model I purchased worked for 8 years before the batteries wore out. It was a economy unit, model number 815RX.
I decided to buy a more deluxe shaver this time, and bought the model 7865XL shown here. It was more expensive than the old one. I charged and used the shaver this morning and was pleasantly suprised with its performance. The heads are floating within their retaining assembly and they conform to the curves on the face nicely. The shave was excellent and my skin was left soft.
To those who don't regularly use an electric shaver - some advice. In order for it to work properly, you MUST wash and then dry your face. If I don't do this, I have found that my skin will become irritated and red. It works even better if you use soap with cream in it during the wash (acts a lubricant), but just washing with water and a wash rag works well too.

2.0,"I owned an older model Remington three head shaver for about 2 years before I bought this one.  It always gave me a close shave without having to make multiple passes or contort my face.
But I dropped it a few times and cracked the plastic head for it which I couldn't find a replacement for.  So I upgraded and paid over $100 for what I thought was a quality electric shaver.
I am very disappointed with this shaver.  I can get a close shave with it, but I have to go over the same spot 5 to 6 times to get it smooth even after the so called ""two week"" waiting period.  I just purchased the new Remington Titanium self cleaning model as I feel it will work much better, judged by the performance of my older Remington.  I gave it two stars only because the flip up shaver works well.

4.0,"I bought this shaver to replace my Mach III blade. I have used it for over a month, past the amount of time it takes your skin and face to get used to it. Nothing will shave as close as the Mach III; the Norelco gets close to it, but does it more quickly. I have never owned an electric razor before this one, so I have nothing to compare it to. However, here is my opinion:
PROS:
*Shaves very close
*Easy to clean
*Runs for a long time between charges
*Charges quickly
*Conforms to your face well
*Useful voltage converter
*Nice carrying case
*Contrary to a previous reviewer, it does have one flat edge where it won't roll of the table
CONS:
*Trimmer doesn't trim as well as I'd like it to
*Takes a few weeks for your skin to get used to it and get a close shave","Great shaver, easy to use, close shave","['buy', 'shaver', 'replace', 'mach', 'iii', 'blade', 'use', 'month', 'past', 'amount', 'time', 'take', 'skin', 'face', 'get', 'use', 'nothing', 'shave', 'close', 'mach', 'iii', 'norelco', 'get', 'close', 'quickly', 'never', 'own', 'electric', 'razor', 'one', 'nothing', 'compare', 'however', 'opinion', 'pro', 'shaves', 'close', 'easy', 'clean', 'run', 'long', 'time', 'charge', 'charge', 'quickly', 'conform', 'face', 'well', 'useful', 'voltage', 'converter', 'nice', 'carry', 'case', 'contrary', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'one', 'flat', 'edge', 'wo', 'nt', 'roll', 'table', 'con', 'trimmer', 'nt', 'trim', 'well', 'like', 'take', 'week', 'skin', 'get', 'use', 'get', 'close', 'shave']"

I can shave in less than 5 min and I have side burns that the combs can go around the edges; of course with some help from my hand.  As I hold the hair upward, the electric razor does it job.

5.0,"AXE BODY SPRAY: The best product around is ""Axe body spray."" It comes in a variety of scents, Apollo, Voodoo, Hypnotic, Phoenix, Orion, Gravity, Pulse, Essence, Dark Temptation, Instinct, and of course, Kilo. The Axe products are made by a British company called, ""Unilever."" They first started putting out their products in France in 1983, and slowly migrated their products to other countries, till it got introduced here in the US in 2001. Since then, Axe has been a big hit for many young and old.

AXE KILO SCENT: The main thing is, since every guy has a different preference in what scents he will like, you will have to go to the store and choose which one you like best. I bought the ""Axe Kilo"" yesterday, and I love it! It has a sort of fruit scent to it with a hint of Carmel. However, the scent is just right, where I believe most men, will like the Kilo scent. It smells really good to me, is not overpowering, yet is quite seductive to the females. The best part is, you should be able to like their products, as Unilever caters their Axe body sprays to guys of all ages.

If you are sunburned, or have a cut on your skin, I highly recommend that you don't use body spray. As it will burn like crazy due to the alcohol content.

HOW LONG DOES IT LAST: Since the scent is not super strong, I find the scent will last about a good 6-hours at least. If you require that a scent last all day long, I would refer you to a stronger product such as Axe Phoenix, or Axe Pulse.

CONCLUSION: I am really into the Axe products now, cause I find their scents to be some of the best on the market for men. Heck, I am planning on buying the Axe shower gell stuff next! I really like the Axe Kilo scent, and it covers up body odor well, when I'm not able to just take a shower. Would I buy Axe Kilo again?

4.0,"First of all, get the 8831xl, NOT this 8825xl which simply isn't worth spending over $100 on.  That's the only reason I gave it just 4 stars instead of the perfect 5.  The 8831xl gets 5/5 stars.  You can always return any Norelco shaver within 2 months for a full refund, so get your hands on any Norelco Spectra shaver ASAP!
After buying the 8825, I found the 8831 on eBay and I called Norelco and asked what this unlisted model was all about.  They said it's a special model that they only sell to certain department stores, like Macy's, every now and then.  Anyway, the 8825 has only 45 mins of shaving time while the 8831 has 70 mins.  The 8831 package also includes a CAR CHARGER.  And thirdly, the 8831 is pearly white, not blue like the 8825.  Other than these three differences, THAT'S IT, no other differences whatsoever.  Oh wait, there is just one more difference... the price!  The 8825, which is Norelco's entry-level Spectra model, sells for over $100.  The 8831 sells on Ebay for about $60 shipped.  One of Norelco's top-of-the-line shavers for WAY under $100, are you kiddin?!  Nope, it's an absolute steal.  You might be wondering if I own both shavers now... nope!  I bought this 8825 first but then returned it to Norelco within 60 days for a full refund and then bought the 8831 on Ebay brand new for about $60 shipped.
The 8825 was my first electric shaver ever, and I really did need Norelco's recommended 3 weeks for my hair to get used to electric shaving.  By the way, all of the Spectra models shave the same, as they don't differ with their blades.  It's just that the higher models like 8890 and 8894 have fancy displays and bells and whistles, none of which make for a better shave than the 8825 or 8831.  Anyway, I was using Mach 3 razors for the past few years.  The Mach 3 was great for my face, but I rarely could ever get a close AND comfortable shave on my neck without irritating it and getting red bumps, and I could never comfortably shave every morning, it always had to be at least every 36 hours or every other day.  But with my new Norelco Spectra, now I can shave every morning without ANY irritation and I can also comfortably shave my neck CLOSER than a blade now.  Sixty bucks to feel like a million.

5.0,"I just got my first Norelco model 8825 XL, after 7 years using a Braun 4501. I considered these two brands the top in the electrical shaving industry. In some aspects I founded the Norelco reigning over the Braun and in other aspects the Braun is much better. So, the question you should ask yourself is what type of hair are you trying to shave?
Let first look at the Norelco series:
The different between the Norelco's Spectra (8000 series), Quadra (7000 series), Advantage (6000 series), and the Reflex (5000 series) is one major feature added to each series. The Reflex sports the basic ""Lift & Cut"" system. The Advantage is the same but include a lotion dispenser. The Quadra's ""Lift and Cut"" system has two types of head with a slot and hole. The Spectra series has what the Quadra does, but include a comfort control. Both the Quadra and Spectra don't have lotion dispenser. There are also more special features that can be found in each series by looking at the 2nd digit. For example the Spectra 8894 have a digital screen where the bare-bone lower number Spectra 8825 have just a green light.
The performances, Norelco vs. Braun:
I have soft hair in the beard area and thicker hair around the lips (mustache and chin area). The Norelco does a superior job in the beard area; it cut it clean with a couple of strokes. When using the Braun (older model 4501), I sometime have to use a long trimmer and then go back over with the coil. The Norelco three individual heads move over the sides of the face a lot better. Braun does do a superior job over the mustache area. It coils has more and bigger holes then Norelco. The Spectra with it dual slot and hole head is good but takes longer time to cut down the thicker stub. The old Braun battery (NH-) is dying on me. Norelco battery (NiCd) is replaceable and you use it charged or just plug and play, which the Braun could not do. Overall, I prefer the Norelco's design.
The features I like:
I am still playing with the Personal Comfort Control and am not sure if it is necessary. The more sensitive the level is the long it takes to cut so far.

4.0,"This is my chance to see if the reviews you read here are from real people that got the product.. :)

I got this shaver a month ago..

I was using a regular wet razor and got tired of having to run to work with a piece of toilet paper so I could clean the blood coming out of my face.

It was also a pain in the butt having to spread the shaving cream, and then get rid of it every day.

Now I am using the Spectra and I'm very happy with it.

The instructions tell you to give up to 3 weeks for your face to get used to the new shaving system.

But in my opinion, it is just a way for them to make you LEARN first how to use the machine. I did not notice any differences in the skin or shave after the ""getting used to"" period compared to the first day I used the Norelco.

But I do not mean that there is no difference in the skin.

You feel the skin a lot better and softer after the fist shave with this system vs. the razor.

I am still learning how to get the best shave with it.

I have shaved my face to the point that I got a CLOSER shave than the razor a few times. And other times I get a just OK shave, but not as close as before.

I think it depends on how the hair reacts to the machine any given day.

Sometimes I spend more time to get the same results as other days. But no more than 5 minutes.

I always used it in normal mode. This way it is supposed to be the fastest.

My tip to you would be this:

The instructions tell you to shave with your face clean.

But if you shave right after taking your daily shower, is like your face gets humid and less slippery for the Norelco.

I had better results with my face really dry. So I clean my face the night before and shave when I wake up, before taking my shower. This way I have my face clean and really dry.

Sometimes you have to make more than a gentle pressure with the heads on your face to catch and cut the hair closer.

I got some irritation in my lower part of the neck a few times... it is a little difficult to catch the hairs in that area.. may be because the skin is softer in there.

The battery last a lot.

It is a very practical machine, and comes with a pouch so I can shave the mornings I wake up at my girlfriend's home.

No more blood for me. But take care with your lip. Once i catch it a little with the spectra and got a bad feeling in it for a few days.

I think that with some more time, I will perfect the technique and always get the shave I want with the Spectra 8825XL.

I recommend this machine to anyone. It is great.

4.0,"I'm almost 50 and have been using an electric razor most of my shaving life. When my trusty Norelco needed replacing, my wife bought me the latest self-cleaning Braun for a Christmas gift. I liked some aspects of it, but it always had a hard time shaving my neck area without going back over it a lot of times. Replacing the cutter and screen every 6 months or so helped keep it from getting progressively worse, but after a couple of years, I thought I would try something different.

I read MANY reviews and decided to try the Norelco Spectra system. I've been using it for several months now and I can tell you the difference on my neck is like night and day. The Norelco is MUCH faster and smoother than the Braun and cuts very close after only a couple of passes. I was amazed at how much better it was than even my old triple-head Norelco.

If I were to have ANY negative, it would be the charging system. The first problem is, if you provide a recharging ""stand"", then the logic (IMO) should be that the stand be allowed to be plugged in 24/7 with the razor in it, without any adverse affects. However, MANY places in the manual tell you DOING THIS WILL SHORTEN THE LIFE OF YOUR BATTERY.

Because they use a NiCad battery, they ask that you only recharge it when it runs low to avoid the ""memory"" effect and associated diminished capacity. I can understand that, but the second problem is, it gets fully charged in only 4 hours! After that, you are supposed to remove it from, or unplug, the stand to avoid overcharging. Unfortunately, most of us shave in the morning before a work day, then don't return for at least 9-10 hours. In my case, a 12 or even 24 hour charge would be far more convenient. What's so hot about a ""4-hour charge"" anyway?? OK, how about I push a button to start the charge cycle, and it automatically shuts off when fully charged! How easy is that? (Gee, that's exactly how my Braun worked.)

Being an Electrical Engineer myself, I'm sometimes overly critical of things like this. OK, if it were me, (are you listening Norelco???) I would have used a NiMH battery that didn't have to be ""deep cycled"", then use a lower current ""trickle charge"" base that could be left on 24/7. A side benefit is when you pack for a trip and grab your razor, you KNOW it's always 100% charged and will probably have enough juice to last the entire trip without dragging the charger along.

OK, maybe the charger is not as bad as I make it out to be. I just think it could be better.

1.0,"I sent this to Norelco and asked that it be passed on to the engineering and marketing people who created this product.

I hate this razor!  I used to have a 5814XL that finally died.  It was one of many Norelco razors that I have had for over 35 years.  When I needed to replace the 5814XL, I bought the 8825XL and after using it for 7 months, have come to despise its ability to provide a close shave.  Here are my comments on that deficiency as well as others:

1.  Even right out of the box, this shaver did not provide as close a shave as the old 5814XL.

2.  I suspect that in order to make it easy to clean, the cutting mechanism was modified to emphasize chopping the hairs up very finely.  In fact, I observe that the debris is indeed smaller than in the 5814XL.  Unfortunately it is so small that it falls out of the holes in the cutter heads thereby making a mess in the bathroom.  I think this may have compromised the ability of the 8825XL to shave close.

3.  The removal of the AC-DC converter from the shaver body to the cord is a mistake.

4.  The cord becomes unwieldy to store especially in the pouch.  The converter plug is so heavy, it falls out of any socket that is a bit loose.  This is especially a problem when shaving with the cord attached.

5.  The cord with its huge plug does not coil well.  The presence of the plug prevents the cord from being curled into any sort of small ball.  In fact, the stiffness and direction of the exit of the cord from the plug prevents the cord from being even closely wound around the plug.  This means that the cord and plug have effectively become twice as large.

6.  Presumably the point of removing the AC-DC converter to the plug was to reduce the size of the shaver body.  This was probably due to some styling guys wanting a ""sexy"" shape.  The shape is also a problem.  The shaver wants to tip over when stored on a shelf on its back.  Clearly the engineers noted this and added the two vestigial bumps on the back.  That this was an afterthought is clear since the bumps are so small - the result of ensuring that the plastic housing ejected easily from the mold during production.

7.  The adjustment wheel does not stay in the N position.  There is not enough friction to maintain that setting.  It constantly wants to move toward the S position.

8.  The desire to have the head on a hinge has also caused problems.  The detent that holds the hinge in the shaver body is not big enough.  Sometimes when I open the head to clean it, the spring action of the hinge and the smallness of the detent result in the head actually flipping off of the shaver.  Once this resulted in all of the head guts coming out.  As a result, I am no longer sure that the cutters are matched up.  However, do not attribute the lack of closeness of shave to this happening.  It did not shave close even before the head popped off.

9.  Since you have designed the head to flip open, the plastic cover that protects the head during storage no longer has threefold symmetry.  As a result one has to look to see that the cover is oriented correctly.  That is really dumb!

10.  The detents on the protective cover are not strong enough.  The cover wants to pop off particularly when you try to put the shaver in the storage pouch.

11.  The storage pouch that provided is hard to use.  It appears to be too small, although I think this would not be the case if the protective head cover were more secure and if the cord coiled more neatly with the huge plug.

I have now purchased a Norelco 6863XL.  It works really well and I am pleased.

5.0,"I bought an 8825XL about two years ago. Prior to that I had used Brauns for many years. I am very happy with my Norelco.

I kept buying Braun razors because, when new, they give a very nice shave. The problem, for me, was that the shave quality deteriorated quickly because the foils in the head are so darned delicate. So I would buy a new Braun and  in about 3 months it would need a new foil. But, of course, I didn't really want to put out the $30 quite that often so I would go for months with a poor shave. I would usually buy new foil and blade when I started getting nicked up. I bought the Braun with the cleaning system, thinking that taking the cleaning out of human hands would fix it. Didn't work that way, though. I was getting a little more out of a foil but I was paying $5 per month for the juice.

Anyway, I gave up and bought this Norelco. The first shave was _very_ nice. Just as good as a new Braun. And now, two years later, I have still not bought a blade set for it. The shaves are at least 90% as comfortable as when new.

The Norelco has been reliable and it is easy to clean. Once every couple of months I take the heads apart and clean the blades with alcahol. My wife commented on how quiet it was the first time I used it.

I also LOVE the fact that I can just rinse the Spectra under warm water to clean the blades and heads...it's so much more convenient than using a brush with the Reflex.

5.0,"Tried it once before I tossed it...and now it's the only one I use.

I have very dry skin and make up crepes under my eyes as a result.  Yes, I've tried many other creams (specifically, every one olay has ever come out with); I've also tried setting it with different powders after watching youtube videos.  For me, powder was the worst choice.

Since most beauty products cater to oily or combination skin,  I imagine that those of us with truly dry skin are more of a minority and so it's reasonable that this won't work for a lot of people.

But if you're like me and you could probably cover your face in olive oil and think, ""damn, now my skin looks nice"", this might be for you.  It is truly the only thing I've used that doesn't make my concealer or foundation crepe.

One reviewer compared it to Vaseline, which it is definitely not.  However, I can see where she was coming from.  It's thick and oily and just what my skin needs.  It also lasts longer than any dermatologist would recommend keeping it for.
